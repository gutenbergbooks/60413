</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One can be nineteen and still know a great
deal of the world. Ruth Mayfield felt that
she knew a great deal of the world. She
could judge character, and taking care of Mother’s
business affairs had helped a lot, and like most young
women of nineteen she knew that if marriage offered
no more to her than it had offered to her parents,
she did not want to marry. Of course they hadn’t
quarrelled or anything, but they lived such dull lives,
and there were always money worries—and everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth had never told her mother any of these
things, especially after her father died and her
mother had cried so much and had seemed to feel
even worse than Ruth did, for Ruth <i>had</i> felt badly.
She had been awfully fond of her father, really
fonder of him than of her mother. He understood
her better and it was he who had encouraged her
to study art.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was one of the things that set her apart
from other girls in Indianapolis. She was an art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>student. One day she would do great things, she
knew.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she was a very little girl she had intended
to write. She decided this because nothing gave her
so much pleasure as reading, not the sort of books
that delight the hours of the average childhood, but
books which, had her mother ever taken the trouble
to look at them, would have made her rather concerned
for the future of the small reader. But
Mrs. Mayfield never troubled to look. The books
all came from the Indianapolis public library, so
they must be all right. They were fairy tales at first
and later mythology. The mythology of the Greeks
and Romans which somehow never stepped out of
the marble for her; and the intensely human mythology
of the Icelanders and of the Celts which she
liked better, and later the mythology of India which
fascinated her most of all because it had apparently
neither beginning nor end. While her mother and
her mother’s friends were dabbling in Christian
Science and “New Thought” she was lost in the
mysteries of the transmigration of souls. Perhaps
it was all this delving into the past that gave to her
wide brown eyes what is called the spirituelle look—a
look decidedly contradicted by her sturdy body;
perhaps, too, it was extensive reading that finally
decided her not to try to write, but to express herself
in painting, a medium through which she could
depict emotions and dramas rather than ideas and
facts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>There came to her at the age of fourteen a
development which, while it increased her faith in
things supernormal and for a while fascinated her
into a deeper delving into the religions of the East,
had the final effect of frightening her away from
things of the mind and turning her activities into
more beautiful channels. She had read of the objectification
of ideas and the materialization of
thoughts and wanted to try to do these things herself,
without quite knowing what exercise she should
make of her knowledge even though it came to her.
Like many people of a spiritual yet intense nature,
of her five senses the sense of smell was the keenest.
She liked flowers for their odour more than for colour
or form. One winter day when she had returned
home from school and was sitting alone with her
books—looking out at the snow-laden trees instead
of studying—she thought of spring and violets; she
was tired of winter, eager for the spring to come
again, and she tried to see violets, to catch their
scent and their colour. She closed her eyes and shut
out the winter room and the frost-rimmed window—all
around her in great warm waves of fragrance
rose the odour of violets—exquisite English violets
with the freshness of the woods in them. She took
deep breaths, keeping her eyes closed lest the
miracle should fade. Then when she had quite satisfied
herself that she really did smell violets she
opened her eyes. All about her on the floor, on the
table, covering her schoolbooks, they lay, great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>heaps of odorous purple blossoms mingled with
rich green leaves. With a little cry of pleasure and
amazement she stretched out her hands to gather
them in and they were gone. The room was as it
had been before, but the odour was not gone. For
many minutes the fragrance of violets filled her nostrils.
She was afraid to close her eyes again to bring
back the vision, but the following day she tried
again, and many times afterward. She tried different
flowers, carnations and Chinese lilies. She could
not always see the flowers, but she seldom failed
with the odour. The game fascinated her so that
she spent every moment that she could find alone in
materializing flowers. Then came to her the desire
to take the next step—to make other people realize
her power. Her mother, being the least imaginative
person she knew as well as the one most conveniently
near, she decided to try with her. It was one evening
when her father was not at home. Her mother was
busy embroidering—one of those never to be finished
articles of no conceivable use, which occupy the
hands of women who have no active interest in life.
Ruth was pretending to read. She dared not shut
her eyes lest her mother should observe. But she
bent unseeing eyes over her book and concentrated
on the inner vision of the mystic—shutting out
everything except the thought of violets. They
were her mother’s favourite flower. For many seconds
after she herself was surrounded by the odour
of violets and could see them on her book, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>mother did not speak. Then she looked up restlessly
from her embroidery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you been using perfume, Ruth?—you
know I don’t approve of young girls—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Mother, I haven’t. I haven’t any to use.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I smell perfume—violet perfume—it’s more like
real violets than just perfume—don’t you notice it?
The whole room is heavy with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dropped her embroidery and moved about the
room as if hunting for the flowers though she knew
there were none there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been my imagination—it’s gone
now. Strange, I was sure I smelt violets. I must
ask Doctor Gorton about it. It may be a dangerous
symptom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth did not speak. She was rather ashamed
and not a little frightened. There was nothing of
the mischievous about her. She did not want to
play tricks. She had just wanted to test her power,
but this was the last time that she consciously tried
to use it. For some time the illusion of flowers persisted
whenever she thought of them, but she tried
not to think of them and before many months the
experiment was a thing of the past. It persisted in
Ruth only in a deep-rooted faith in the power of
mind, and in the truth of many things that the average
person considered superstition. When she
heard of deaths and births and marriages—of good
luck and bad luck—of coincidences and accidents,
it seemed to her that behind the obvious and accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>causes of all these things she could trace an inner
and spiritual reason—the working of forces that
laughed at the clumsy working of material
machinery. Yet she no longer delved. For a while
she actually made a conscious effort to look at life
in the ordinary way. She was helped in this by the
death of her father, which placed her in a position
of responsibility toward her invalid mother, and
made her life too full of reality to leave much room
for the occult and supernatural.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hadn’t realized quite how much she had loved
her mother until she died. Mother had been old-fashioned
and fussy, but then all invalids were fussy,
and she had been a dear about letting her go on with
her studies after Father died, even though she
wouldn’t move to Chicago as Ruth wished. They
could have lived as cheaply in Chicago and Ruth
could have gone to the art institute there, but
Mother wouldn’t consent to the move. She wanted
to stay near her friends. Ruth couldn’t understand
that. Her mother’s friends were all such ordinary
people. Kind-hearted, but quite hopelessly ordinary.
It was curious that her mother’s death had realized
for her one of her most cherished dreams. Mother
knew that she was going to die. The doctors had
told her so, and she had told Ruth. It made Ruth
cry, but her mother didn’t shed any tears. That was
why Ruth did. If her mother had cried Ruth would
have been more controlled, but her mother was so
unnaturally calm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“When I am gone I want you to go to your
father’s sister, Gloria Mayfield. I hate to send you
there, but there’s no one else of your blood, and
you’re too young to live alone. Gloria has retired
from the stage and they say she is quite respectable
now, and besides you won’t be dependent on her.
Now that there will be no more doctors’ bills to pay,
there will be enough money for you to live on, more
than any young girl ought to have in her own hands.
It is all in trust and you will have just the income
until you are twenty-one.” Ruth made no comment
to this. Having handled her mother’s business affairs
she knew that her income would be very small
indeed, but she and her mother had different ideas
as to how much a young girl should spend. “Of
course I expect you to pay your way with your aunt,”
her mother went on. “But you must live with some
older woman and she is your father’s sister.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She said it as if the fact that Gloria Mayfield was
her father’s sister answered all arguments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where does Aunt Gloria live, Mother?” asked
Ruth. She accepted the fact that her mother would
die soon without making an effort to persuade either
herself or her mother that there was any hope that
the doctors might be mistaken. She had known for
years that her mother would not live long. Doctors,
New Thought, Christian Science, and Theosophy
had all been appealed to without having any appreciable
effect on her mother’s health. Ruth being
perfectly healthy was inclined to have faith in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>New Thought. She disliked the Science because of
the word Christian, but was inclined to believe that
any one of these numerous things might have helped
if used alone. When her father had died first it had
seemed unreal—impossible almost, for Ruth and her
father had always expected her mother to go first,
though neither of them would have put such a
thought into words. It was just an unspoken understanding
between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In New York,” Mrs. Mayfield had answered;
and Ruth was ashamed that her first thought on
hearing this amazing news was that in New York
she could study in the best American art schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How old is she?” asked Ruth. She had been
a bit troubled by her mother’s words about an older
woman. Ruth had no desire to go to New York
to be controlled by some elderly female relative.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. I never saw her. In her younger
days she was abroad a great deal, and then I never
cared to meet her. She was younger than your
father, quite a lot younger, but she must have
reached years of discretion by this time. I hope so
for your sake. Perhaps I’m not doing the right
thing by telling you to go to her, but after all she is
your father’s sister and will be your only relative
after I am gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you written to her—do you want me to
write?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I didn’t write to her before and I can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>start now. You will go to her after I’m gone
as your father’s daughter. Your claim on her is
through him, not me. You can write to her yourself
as soon—as soon as you know. Her address is in
that little red book on the desk—at least that was
her address five years ago, when your poor father
died. She didn’t come to the funeral, though she
did write to me, and she may have moved since. She
probably has. I think on the whole you’d better
write now so that the letter will have time to follow
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth did write and her aunt had not moved, for
by a curious coincidence Aunt Gloria’s answer came
on the very day that her mother died. At the time,
concerned with her grief, Ruth didn’t read the letter
very carefully, but afterward—after the funeral,
and after all the innumerable details had been settled,
she went back to it and read it again. She
didn’t know exactly what to think of it. It filled her
with doubts. Almost she persuaded herself to disregard
her mother’s wish and not go to Aunt Gloria
at all, but she had already told all her mother’s kind
friends that that was what she would do. It gave
her a logical excuse for refusing all of the offers of
the well-meaning women who asked her to come
and stop with them “for a few weeks at least until
you are more yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth realized that she had never felt so much
herself as she did now—rather hopelessly alone and
independent in a way that frightened her. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>kind women were all her mother’s friends, not hers.
She had none. She had always prided herself on
being different from other girls and not interested
in the things they cared for—boys and parties and
dress. Even at the art school she had found the
other students disappointingly frivolous. They had
not taken their art seriously as she did. The letter
was curious:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child,” she had written, “by all means
come to me in New York if your mother dies. But
why anticipate? She’ll probably live for years. I
hope so. To say I hope so sounds almost like a lack
of hospitality and to send you an urgent invitation
to come, under the circumstances, sounds—This is
getting too complicated. Come whenever you need
me, I’m always at home now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the letter was signed with her full name,
Gloria Mayfield. She had not even called Ruth
niece, or signed herself “your loving aunt,” or anything
that might be reasonably expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth might have lingered on at home, but she
had refused the hospitality of her mother’s friends
and the house was empty and desolate and she was
dressed in black. She hadn’t wanted to dress in
black, but she hadn’t the courage to shock people by
continuing to wear colours, so she hurriedly finished
all the ghastly business that some one must always
finish after a funeral, and then she packed her
trunks, putting in all the pictures and books that
she liked best, and took a train for New York. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>had a plan in the back of her mind about a studio
there. She had never seen a real studio, but she had
read about them, and if Aunt Gloria proved disagreeable,
she would go and live in one. She wondered
a bit what sort of a place Aunt Gloria lived
in. The address sounded aristocratic and sort of
English, Gramercy Square. She liked the sound
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her mother’s death had hurt her cruelly, but she
was so young that already she was beginning to rebound.
The journey helped to revive her spirits.
Everything interested her, but her first sight of New
York disappointed her vaguely. If she had known,
her disappointment was caused only because the cab
driver took her down Fourth Avenue instead of
Fifth, and there was little to interest her in the dull
publishing buildings and wholesale houses, and she
missed even the shabby green of Madison Square.
Her spirits rose a bit when the cab turned into
Gramercy Square. All the fresh greenness of it,
the children playing within the iron-barred enclosure,
the old-fashioned houses and clubs and the
big, new apartment buildings looking so clean and
quiet in the morning sunlight, appealed to her. She
rather expected the cab to stop before one of the
apartment houses, but instead it stopped on the
north side of the park. Her aunt lived in a house
then. This was also cheering. The cab driver
carried her bag for her up the high steps and she
rang the bell with a fast-beating heart. She didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>know exactly what she had expected—perhaps that
Aunt Gloria would open the door in person—and she
started back when it was opened by a tall negro who
looked as startled as herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Aunt Gloria—is Miss Mayfield at home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you expected?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke in a soft, precise voice unlike the voice
of any nigger Ruth had ever heard before. She
knew he must be a servant though he was not in
livery, and she looked at him as she answered, suddenly
impressed by his regular features, his straight
hair, and yellow-brown skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She didn’t know exactly when I’d come, but she
knew I was coming. I am her niece.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant picked up her bag, which the cab
driver had left beside her and opened the door wider
for her to come in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mayfield is at home. I’ll let her know
that you are here if you will wait a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was in a wide hall now from which an open
staircase rose to rooms above. The hall was very
cheerful with white woodwork and grey walls hung
with etchings in narrow black frames. Uninvited
Ruth perched hesitatingly on the edge of a
Chippendale chair and waited. The coloured man
walked to the far end of the hall, opened a door
there and called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Amy, come here, you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amy came, a round, short, black woman of the
type most familiar to Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>To her the man evidently explained the situation,
but his soft voice did not carry to Ruth’s end of the
hall; not so the voice of Amy. Ruth could hear her
replies quite plainly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mis’ Mayfiel’ a’n yit had her breakfus’—I’se
jes now makin’ de tray—ef you sez so I’ll tell her,
but dis a’n no hour to be talkin’ to Mis’ Mayfiel’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Amy and the man disappeared through the
door and soon Amy emerged again carrying a breakfast
tray. She went past Ruth and up the stairs.
Ruth was growing impatient and rather offended.
Of course she should have sent a wire, but even so,
Gloria Mayfield was her aunt and she should have
been taken to her at once. Evidently her aunt ate
breakfast in bed. Perhaps she was an invalid like
her mother. Ruth hoped not. Evidently too she
had a lot more money than Ruth had supposed. Her
impatience was not alleviated when Amy came down
the stairs again without speaking to her. It was unbearable
that she should sit here in the hall of her
aunt’s house, ignored like a book agent. In another
moment the man had reappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mayfield will see you as soon as she can
dress, Miss, and would you like breakfast in your
room or downstairs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had picked up Ruth’s bag as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve had breakfast,” said Ruth. She had indeed
eaten breakfast in Grand Central Station. It was
only seven o’clock in the morning when she arrived
in New York, and that had seemed rather an early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>hour for even a relative to drop into her aunt’s
home unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She followed the servant up the stairs, mentally
commenting on how she hated “educated niggers.”
Yet she had to admit there was nothing disrespectful
in his manner. He set her bag down in one of
the rooms opening out of the circular landing and
asked for her trunk checks, and suggested sending
Amy up to make her comfortable. She gave him
the trunk checks, refused the offer of Amy’s help,
and when he had closed the door sat down to examine
her surroundings and wait for the appearance
of her aunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been a certain charm about the
entrance hall and stairway of the house, but the
room in which she found herself was as uninteresting
as possible. It was large and high-ceiled and almost
empty and streamers of loosened and discoloured
wall paper hung from the walls. It was in the rear
of the house. The few essential pieces of furniture
in the room made it look even larger than it really
was. It looked like what it was, a very much unused
bedroom in a house very much too large for its
inhabitants. She walked to the window and looked
out, but the view did not interest her. It was only
of the rear of the houses on Twenty-second Street.
The house opposite had a tiny back garden that ran
out to meet a similar back garden in the rear of her
aunt’s house. Ruth did not call this plot of ground
a garden, because it had nothing growing in it except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>one stunted, twisted tree on the branches of which
September had left a dozen pale green leaves. It
made her think of an anæmic slum child. Looking
at it Ruth felt suddenly very sad and neglected. She
had hoped that her aunt would not be too much like
a relative, but now she began to persuade herself
that she had looked forward to the embracing arms
of a motherly aunt, and her cold reception had quite
broken her heart. Instead of a fussy, motherly
relative she had found a cold, selfish woman living in
a house much too large, surrounded by servants—Ruth
had only seen two but there were probably
more. She was unwelcome; she had been shoved
off into the shabbiest room in the house by an insolent
servant. But she was not a pauper. She would tell
her aunt very coldly that she had only come to pay
her respects and was going immediately to an hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, Aunt Gloria; I couldn’t think of imposing
on you,” she could hear herself saying, and of
course then her aunt would urge her to stay, but
she wouldn’t. What could her aunt do in such a big
house? It was four floors and a basement. It must
be full of shabby, unused rooms like this one. Just
then there was a knock at the door, and she hadn’t
even smoothed her hair or powdered her nose as she
had intended doing before her aunt sent for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come in,” she said. Her voice sounded husky
and unused. The words were scarcely out of her
mouth when the door opened and a woman swept
into the room—the tallest woman she had ever seen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>at least six feet tall and slender without being thin—a
graceful tiger lily of a woman with masses of
auburn hair and big grey, black-lashed eyes and a
straight white nose and a crushed flower of a mouth.
With one hand she was holding a gorgeous, nameless
garment of amber silk and lace and the other hand
was held out to Ruth. Even as she took it Ruth
realized that it would have been preposterous to
have expected the goddess to kiss her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting—Ruth,”
she said. Her voice was like silver bells ringing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should have wired,” admitted Ruth. Her
voice sounded flat and toneless after hearing her aunt
speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would have been awkward if I hadn’t happened
to be in town, but I was, so it’s all right.
You’re older than I thought, I was afraid that you’d
turn out a little girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’re ever so much younger than I
thought, Aunt Gloria,” said Ruth, beginning to gain
her composure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thirty-five last birthday,” said her aunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately Ruth realized that thirty-five was
the only possible age for a woman. To be older or
younger than thirty-five was infinitely dull. She herself
at nineteen, which only a few moments ago she
had considered a very interesting age indeed, was
quite hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But come, we mustn’t stay in this awful room.
I didn’t tell George just where to take you. Certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>not here. I’ll have a room fixed up for you.
Did George send for your trunks? He said you’d
had breakfast, but that can’t be true—coffee perhaps,
but not breakfast—I only had coffee myself.
So we can eat together while they’re getting a room
ready for you.” She was sweeping Ruth along with
her down the stairs as she talked, not waiting for
answers to anything she said. At the foot she turned
and opened a door at the left of the staircase and
peered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too gloomy in the dining-room in the morning.
We’ll go in here,” and she turned to the other side,
opening a door into a big room, all furnished in soft
grey and dull gold. Ruth’s artist eye perceived
how such a neutral-tinted background was just the
thing to enhance the colourful appearance and personality
of her aunt. The only touch of vivid colour
in the room was in the hangings at the deep, high
windows that looked out on the park.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have Amy bring our breakfast in here,” said
Gloria, and then Ruth saw that George was standing
in the doorway of the room they had just entered,
though she had not heard her aunt call him. Later
she observed the same thing many times, that George
always appeared as if by magic and seemingly
without being called whenever her aunt wanted
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room was full of comfortable, low, cushioned
chairs, and seated on two of them with a table
between, on which George had laid a white cloth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Ruth and her aunt Gloria gave each other that full
scrutiny which surprise and embarrassment had
previously denied them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth could see now that her aunt was not really
so young as she had at first appeared. There were
fine lines around her large eyes and art, not nature
had painted her lashes black. Her fine brows had
been “formed” and there were little, pale freckles
gleaming on her white nose and across her long,
cleanly moulded hands. Ruth saw all these things
and they only strengthened her belief that Aunt
Gloria was the most beautiful and charming woman
in the world. She hoped very much that her aunt
would like her, but she was not sanguine about it.
She tried to tell herself that this woman was only
her father’s sister, but it was hard to believe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, tell me all about it,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s very little to tell. Mother died on the
tenth—your letter arrived on the same day. Of
course it wasn’t unexpected. She had been an invalid
for almost ten years, so it wasn’t a shock. I was
the only relative at the funeral, but Mother had ever
so many friends—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She paused, wondering if she ought to tell Aunt
Gloria about the flowers, the Eastern Star wreath,
and—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t mean that,” Gloria interrupted her
thoughts. “I mean how your mother happened to
suggest that you come here. You know Jack’s wife
didn’t approve of me—refused to meet me even,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and I can’t understand. Was there some sort of
deathbed forgiveness, or what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the faintest trace of mockery in her
voice, but somehow Ruth could not be angry, though
she knew that this woman, her father’s sister, was
laughing at her dead mother and her dead mother’s
conventions and moralities. She decided that she
would be as frank as her aunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Aunt Gloria, I don’t think Mother’s views
had changed at all. She sent me here because
you are my only living relative and she thought I
was too young to live alone—and I came,” she continued
bravely, “because New York is the best place
in America to study art and I want to be a great
painter. But if you don’t want me here I’ll live
alone—I have money you know, and Mother intended
that I should pay my own way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand,” said Gloria, nodding. “That
would be in character—a sort of blood is stronger
than Bohemia idea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then,” continued Ruth, determined to be
absolutely frank, “I think Mother was under the
impression that you were older than you are, and
had settled down—you have retired from the
stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Gloria laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child, I’ve done nothing but retire
from the stage ever since I first went on it, but that
doesn’t matter. I agree with your mother that you
will be much better off here with me than alone, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>I shall be very glad to have you—it means one more
permanent resident in this huge barn of a house.
Only please don’t call me Aunt. Call me Gloria.
My being your aunt is more or less of an accident.
The fact that I like you is of vastly more importance,
and if you like me we shall get on very well together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you’re wonderful,” admitted Ruth,
blushing deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, then, you shall stay here—you can
have two rooms or more if you want ’em, fixed up
to suit yourself, and you can spend your income on
your clothes and your education—but you will be
here as my guest, not as my relative. I dislike
relatives inordinately—don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without giving Ruth time to reply she went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you thought about where you’re going to
study?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I suppose there are a number of places.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are, of course; the Art Students’ League
is one of the best. The associations there should be
good. You’ll be working with the strugglers. How
old are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nineteen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nineteen and the whole world before you, work
and failure and success and New York and Paris
and your first love affair—you’re young and you
don’t have to nibble at the loaf; you can take big,
hungry bites, and when the time for nibbling does
come, you’ll have a banquet to remember.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Where is the Art Students’ League?” asked
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her aunt fascinated her; she talked “like a
book,” Ruth thought, but Ruth herself was practical
despite her dreaming and the talk of art schools interested
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s a school with small fees—if you have
a lot of talent they give scholarships—I don’t really
know much about it, except that it’s on Fifty-seventh
Street some place, and that it is supposed to be
proper and good. You might try it for a year—then
you’ll probably be wanting Paris. In another
year I may feel old enough to chaperon you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast they went through the house,
planning where Ruth should establish herself, finally
deciding on two rooms on the fourth floor, because
one of them had a skylight and could be used as a
studio, where Ruth could work undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next few days were spent in buying furniture,
in having the rooms redecorated, and in becoming
familiar with New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth was determined not to be impressed by anything,
a determination that led Gloria Mayfield to
suspect that her niece was of a phlegmatic temperament,
and to wonder why she wanted to be an artist.
Only the quiet sense of humour that Ruth displayed
at rare intervals, encouraged her to believe that
having her niece with her might not be a bad arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth on her part discovered that her Aunt Gloria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>had a wide and varied circle of friends and no
particularly well-defined scheme of existence. And
she discovered a little of Gloria Mayfield’s past, the
past that had been so shrouded in mystery in her
mother’s house. It was when Ruth had made a
remark about her aunt living alone in such a large
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is large, but what am I to do?” said
Gloria. “My second husband wished it on me and
my third was kind enough to settle enough income
on me to pay the taxes, and there you are. Of
course I could let it to some one else, but it’s nice
to have a lot of room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth could not disguise her shock and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, didn’t you know?” asked Gloria, smiling
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know you’d been married at all,” said
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only once, really—the others were almost too
casual. I supposed your mother had told you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did they die?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not to my knowledge—I never killed any of
them,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Ruth put this conversation away in the back
of her brain for future reference, along with several
dozen other things that she didn’t exactly understand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth would have liked a scholarship—not
because she could not easily afford the small
fees at the Art Students’ League, but because
a scholarship would have meant that she had unusual
talent; but she didn’t get one. No one seemed
particularly interested in her work. The woman who
enrolled her in the League was as casual as a clerk
in an hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner of the enrolment clerk and the
grandeur of the Fine Arts Building produced a feeling
of insignificance in Ruth that was far from
pleasant. She engaged her locker for the year, and
when she was led to it to put her board and paints
away, and saw the rows upon rows of other lockers,
she felt even smaller. Was it possible that all those
lockers were needed? That so many other girls and
boys were also art students? If there was an art
student for every locker and each of them shared
her determination to become a great painter, the
world would be so flooded with splendid art that
one might better be a stenographer. Then she comforted
herself that all of the students could not possibly
succeeded. Some of them, the girls especially,
would doubtless give up art for marriage and
babies. Some of the men would become commercialized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>go in for illustrating or even advertising, but
she would go “onward and upward,” as her instructor
in Indianapolis had so thrillingly said. She
felt better after that; and seeing her reflection in
a shop window she felt better still. She wasn’t
beautiful, but she was interesting looking, she told
herself. The way she combed her almost black hair
down over her ears Madonna fashion, her little low-heeled
shoes, her complete absence of waist line, all
marked her as “different.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had enrolled for the morning class in portrait
painting from 9:00 to 12:30 and the afternoon class
in life drawing from 1:00 to 4:30 and she would
attend the Friday afternoon lectures on anatomy.
They began at 4:30, after the first of November, so
she could go direct from her life class to the lecture.
She would have liked to attend some of the
evening classes, too, but Gloria had suggested that
she wait a bit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My word, child, it’s all right to work hard. One
must work hard, but don’t spend twenty-four hours
a day at it. It’s bad enough to begin at the unearthly
hour of nine in the morning without spending
your evenings there, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterward Ruth was glad that she had not enrolled
in any of the evening classes. She usually
returned to the house on Gramercy Square about five
o’clock in the afternoon, just when Gloria’s day
seemed to be properly begun, and there were always
people there who interested Ruth, though she took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>little part in the conversation. Ruth would come
into the hall, her sketches under her arm, and Gloria
would call to her and she would walk into the big
comfortable room and be introduced to half a dozen
people, whose names she seldom remembered. The
people would nod to her and go on with their conversation,
and she would sit back listening and
watching, feeling more like an audience at a play
than one of the group of people in a drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the conversation was quite meaningless
to her, but there was one man, one of the few who
did not change in the ever-changing group, who interested
her intensely. She gathered that he was a
playwright and that he had written the book and
lyrics for a musical comedy that was to have its
New York <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première</span></i> soon. One of the other men
called him a show doctor, and said that he had
written lines into over half the shows on Broadway.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of the other people seemed to think him
“terribly clever,” but Ruth didn’t understand all of
the things at which they laughed. They were always
begging him to sing his latest song, and he never
demurred, though any one could tell with half an
ear that he hadn’t any voice at all. He sang in a
queer, half-chanty voice, with a curious appealing
note in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you really like his singing?” she once asked
Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His voice, you mean?” Gloria looked at her
with the little frown between her eyes and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>amused twist to her mouth that Ruth often observed
when her aunt was explaining things to her. “Of
course not; it’s not his voice, it’s his song. He’s
the cleverest song writer in New York, and he’s
already written two fairly successful plays. He’s
young, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he? I thought he must be thirty at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Gloria laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is about thirty, but that isn’t old. He’s a
funny, old dear, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” admitted Ruth. “He dresses oddly—that
is—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what you mean, but you see a man like
Terry Riordan doesn’t have to keep his trousers
pressed. No other man is worth listening to while
Terry is in the room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth decided that she would pay particular attention
to Terry Riordan the next time she met
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her opportunity came the next day. She had gone
out to lunch that day and had been a little late at
life class in consequence, and had to stand up at an
easel in the back instead of sitting among the more
fortunate ones in the front rows, where early arrival
had usually placed her. The model was a man—“Krakowski,
the wrestler,” one of the girls had
whispered to her. “He’s got a wonderful body;
we’re lucky to get him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth could not control a little gasp of admiration
when he stepped on the model throne. He looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>like a statue with his shining smooth-muscled body,
and he stood almost as still. It was several minutes
before Ruth could get the proper, impersonal attitude
toward him. Most of the models had quite
uninteresting faces, but Krakowski had a face almost
as handsome as his body, and there was a half smile
on his lips as if he were secretly amused at the
students. For a second Ruth saw them through his
eyes—thin, earnest-eyed girls, dressed in “arty”
garments, squinting at him over drawing-boards as
if the fate of nations depended on their work, well-dressed
dabblers and shabby strugglers after beauty.
She noted again the two old women, the fat one with
the dyed hair, and the ribbons and art jewelry and
the thin one whose hair was quite frankly grey. The
fat one had attracted Ruth’s attention the very first
day because in the rest period she ran around insisting
that every one near her should look at her
work and offer criticism, and when the instructor
came through she monopolized as much of his time
as possible to his obvious annoyance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Why didn’t they think of studying art twenty
years ago? Ruth wondered. It seemed to her that
the model was thinking the same thing. Then she
forgot his face and began to block in her sketch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl next to her had a scholarship, her name
was Dorothy Winslow, a rather pretty, widemouthed
girl with a shock of corn-coloured bobbed
hair and very merry blue eyes. Out of the corner
of her eye Ruth watched her work. She had large,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>beautiful hands and the ends of her slim fingers were
always smudged with charcoal or blotted up with
paint. She wore a painting-smock of purple and
green batik. Ruth was tremendously impressed,
but tried not to be. She was torn between a desire
to dress in the same manner and a determination to
consider herself superior to such affectations and
remain smug in the consciousness of her conventional
dress. Still she did wonder how she would look with
her hair bobbed. How fast Dorothy Winslow
worked. Her pencil seemed so sure. Never mind,
she must not be jealous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Facility? Facility is dangerous—big things
aren’t done in a few minutes—Rome wasn’t built in
a day,” she said to herself in the best manner of
her instructor in Indianapolis. One thing that
puzzled her was the way the instructors left the
students alone. They were there to teach, why
didn’t they do it? Instead, they passed around
about twice a week and looked at the drawings
and said something like “You’re getting on all
right—just keep it up,” or now and then really gave
a criticism, but more often just looked and passed
on to the next without a word in the most tantalizing
manner possible. The reticence of the instructors
was amply balanced by the loquacity of the students.
They looked at each other’s work and criticized or
praised in the frankest manner possible, and seemingly
without a hint of jealousy or self-consciousness.
It was time to rest. The model left the throne and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>immediately the students all left their drawing-boards
to talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dorothy Winslow leaned over Ruth’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s really awfully nice, the way you’ve got
that line,—” she pointed with one long, slim charcoal-smudged
finger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think so? Thank you,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Krakowski’s lovely to work from, anyway. I’d
love to paint him. He’s got such an interesting
head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—it distracted me from my work a little,”
admitted Ruth. “Why, you’ve almost got a finished
sketch,” she continued, looking at Dorothy’s board.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I always work fast,” admitted Dorothy, “but
I’ll do it all over again a dozen times before the
week is finished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder how she happened to take up art,”
said Ruth, nodding toward the broad back of the
fat lady with the dyed hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, she’s—she’s just one of the perpetual
students—they say she’s been coming here for ten
years—didn’t they have any perpetual students
where you came from? But perhaps this is your first
year?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I studied a year in the Indianapolis Art
School and we didn’t have any perpetual art students.
Is the one with grey hair a perpetual student,
too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; we had one, a man too, in San Francisco
where I came from.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Why do they do it? Isn’t it rather pitiful, or
are they rich women with a fad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed, they’re not rich. I never heard of
a perpetual student who was rich. Why, Camille
De Muth, the fat one, sometimes has to pose in the
portrait class to earn money to pay for her life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does she live?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Lord, as well ask me why is an art student
as how does one live—how do any of us live,
except of course the lucky ones with an allowance
from home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>All the time she was talking, Dorothy Winslow
was moving her hands, defying all the laws of physiology
by bending her long fingers back over the tops
of them, and by throwing one white thumb out of
joint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you haven’t told me why they do it—why
they keep on studying year after year. Don’t they
try to make any use of what they’ve learned?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not that I ever heard of—they’re just—just
art artists. They spend their lives in class and at
exhibitions, but I’ve never tried to understand
them—too busy trying to understand myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do they do when they’re not here?” asked
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They spend their leisure in the cool marble twilight
of the Metropolitan, making bad copies of old
masters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The model had reappeared and they went back
to their boards, but after class Ruth found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Dorothy Winslow was walking by her side toward
Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you go downtown?” asked Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” admitted Ruth. She was really very much
interested in Dorothy, but she was a bit afraid that
the girl would attract attention on the street. She
now had a vivid blue tam with a yellow tassel on
her fluffy hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the ’bus,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So do I, when I can afford it; when I can’t I
walk, but I guess I can spend the dime today. I got
some fashion work to do last week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fashions?” Ruth could not keep the scorn
out of her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know how you feel about that, but one
can’t become Whistler or Sargent all in a day, and
paint and Michelet paper and canvas cost money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be awfully clever to be able to earn
money with your work already,” admitted Ruth, a
bit ashamed of herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have talent,” admitted Dorothy, “but then
so many people have talent. I’ve got an idea that
work counts a whole lot more than talent, but of
course that’s an awfully practical, inartistic idea—only
I can’t help it. I had to come to New York
and I couldn’t come without a scholarship, so I
worked and got it. What do you think about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Work counts of course, but without the divine
spark of genius—one must have talent and genius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and then work added makes the ideal combination.
Why, if only hard work were necessary, any one,
any stevedore or common labourer or dull bookkeeper,
could become a great artist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That doesn’t sound so silly to me. I really think
they could, if the idea only occurred to them and
they didn’t give up. I think any one can be anything
they please, if they only please it long enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was like Ruth to answer this with a quotation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so,” she said. “‘There is a destiny
that shapes our ends, rough-hew them as we may.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps, but some people do a lot more rough-hewing
than others, and I’m going to hew my way
to a position as the greatest American portrait
painter, and it won’t be so rough either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before such blind self-confidence Ruth was dumb.
She also intended to be a great something or other
in the world of art, but she had never thought
definitely enough about it to decide just what it would
be. She did think now, or spoke without thinking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I’ll be the greatest landscape painter—landscapes
with figures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before they parted at Twentieth Street, Ruth had
promised to go to an exhibition with Dorothy on the
following Saturday.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria had given her a latch key and she went into
the house on Gramercy Square without ringing the
bell. She expected to hear her aunt’s voice, but instead
a man’s voice called out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you, Gloria?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>She answered by walking into the drawing-room,
disappointed at not finding Gloria there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Gloria?”</p>

<p class='c007'>They both said it at once, and then they both
laughed. Terry Riordan was very appealing when
he laughed. He had risen at her entrance, and was
standing loose-limbed yet somehow graceful in his
formless tweeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been waiting at least an hour for her,
though it was obvious that George didn’t want me
here. He quite overpowered me with big words and
proper English to explain why he thought my waiting
quite uncalled for.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s like that, but Gloria is sure to come if you
wait long enough,” said Ruth, sinking wearily into
a chair and dropping her sketches beside her on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even if she doesn’t I couldn’t find a more comfortable
place than this to loaf. I’m too nervous to
be any place else in comfort. The show opens tonight.
It was all right at the tryout in Stamford,
but that doesn’t mean much. I want a cigarette, and
George frightened me so that I didn’t dare ask him
where they are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frightened? You, Mr. Riordan?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, you looked like Gloria then. You are
relatives, of course, same name and everything, but
I never noticed any resemblance before. Suppose
you must be distant relatives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria says we must be very distant relatives in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>order to be close friends,” said Ruth, dodging the
invitation to tell the extent of her relationship to
Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for the cigarettes, there should be some in
the blue Ming jar over there, or, if you prefer, you
can roll your own. There’s tobacco in the box—Gloria’s
own tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks; I suppose I could have found it myself,
but I was actually afraid to look around—George
gave me such a wicked look—he did indeed,”
said Terry. “What a wonderful woman
Gloria Mayfield is,” he continued as he lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” said Ruth. “No wonder she has so
many friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every one loves Gloria,” continued Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You love her?” asked Ruth. She felt that this
man was confiding in her. She wondered if he had
proposed to Gloria and if his suit was hopeless.
She felt sorry for him, but even while she sympathized
she could not keep the three husbands out
of her mind. Three husbands were rather overwhelming,
but four! Somehow, it didn’t seem quite
right, even for so amazing a woman as Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say I do love Gloria. Why, she lets
me read everything I’ve written and always applauds.
That’s one of the things I came for today.
I’ve written that number for Dolly Derwent. Want
to hear it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, please; I’d love to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Got to tell some one,” said Terry, and without
waiting for further encouragement, he began singing
in his queer, plaintive voice, that made his words
sound even more nonsensical than they were, a song
the refrain of which was:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Any judge can recognize</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>A perfect lady by her eyes,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And they ain’t got nothing, they ain’t got nothing,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>They ain’t got nothing on me.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think that’ll get across? You know
Dolly Derwent. Don’t you think that will suit
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Ruth had never seen Dolly Derwent, and
looking at Terry Riordan she suddenly decided to
drop pretence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve never seen her,” she admitted, “and while
I suppose your songs are awfully clever and funny,
I don’t know anything about the stage and half the
time I don’t know what you’re all talking about.
You see I haven’t been in New York long and I
spend most of my time at the Art Students’ League
and I’m afraid I’m not much good as a critic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a few moments Terry did not answer. He
just looked at her, smiling. His smile diffused a
warm glow all round her heart as if he were telling
her that he understood all about her and rather
admired her for not understanding all the stage
patter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Suppose you show me your sketches. I don’t
know any more about art than you do about the
stage, so then we’ll be even,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s nothing here that would interest you—just
studies from the life class.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say there’s an idea for a number—chorus of
art students in smocks and artists’ caps and a girl
with an awfully good figure on a model throne—no,
that’s been used. Still there ought to be
some sort of an original variation of the theme.”
He took out his notebook and wrote something
in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I bring tea, Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>George was standing in the doorway, having appeared
suddenly from nowhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thank you, George—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps if we go on just as if we weren’t waiting
for Gloria, she’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d forgotten that we were waiting for her,” said
Terry. “Do you know, I think that nigger is
jealous of me—you know, as dogs are sometimes
jealous of their mistress’ friends—and he’s only
being civil now because I’m talking to you instead
of Gloria. Some day he’s going to put something in
my high ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a terrible thing to say,” said Ruth.
“I’m sure George is perfectly harmless. It’s only
that he doesn’t talk like other niggers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t call him a nigger!” exclaimed Terry,
pretending to be shocked. “Hasn’t Gloria told you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that he is a Hindoo—half-caste I imagine, and he
came from some weird place, and I heartily wish
he’d return to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A Hindoo—that explained George’s appearance,
but it made him more puzzling as a servant than
before. He was not like the imaginations of Hindoos
that her reading had built up, but perhaps as
Terry said he was a half-caste. Terry’s words, for
the moment, surprised her out of speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s Gloria now,” he said. “We must stop
talking treason. She thinks she has the best servants
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria came in, filling the room with cold outer
air mingled with the odour of the violets pinned on
her sables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just look who’s here,” she said, holding a small,
plump, frizzled, blond woman of about forty in
front of her. “Billie Irwin—she came over from
London with the unfortunate ‘Love at First Sight’
company, and here she is with no more engagement
than a trapeze performer with a broken leg—you
know her, don’t you, Terry?—well, anyway you
know her now, and this is Ruth Mayfield—not in the
profession, an artist of a different kind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How interesting!” murmured Billie Irwin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tea? Take it away, George—we don’t want
tea. I want dinner just as soon as Amy can get it.
We’re all going to see the opening of ‘Three Merry
Men.’ You thought I was going to fail you, didn’t
you, Terry? But we’re not, we’ll all be there. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>George, do get a room ready for Miss Irwin. She’s
going to stay for a few days with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She means a few months,” whispered Terry to
Ruth, thereby establishing between them a secret
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Ruth got a new impression of Terry
Riordan. He did not stay to dinner, though Gloria
asked him, but he met them at the theatre. Every
one seemed to know him and treated him as quite
an important person. It was her first experience of
a first night, and she got the impression that these
people were waiting through the acts for the intermissions
instead of waiting through the intermissions
for the acts. Terry wasn’t in their box, he had a seat
in the back of the theatre with Philip Noel, who had
written the music, but he slipped in and out during
the evening to chat and to hear words of praise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you think it’s going to go?” Gloria
asked him when he returned to their box after the
first intermission.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Badly, I’m afraid; I met several of the newspaper
men out there, and they seemed to like it. If
the critics like it, it’s almost sure to close in three
weeks,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t believe it. It is sure to have a long
run,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God knows I did my best to lower the moral
tone of the thing and make it successful,” said
Terry. “If it will only run long enough to give
me some royalties, just long enough to keep me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>going until my comedy is finished, I won’t
care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They chatted on, commenting on the people on
the stage until Ruth lost all sense of illusion. They
took away from her the fairyland sense that had
formerly made the theatre a joy, and as yet she had
not acquired the knowledge of stagecraft that gives
the stage a stronger fascination for theatrical folk
than for the people who have never seen it in any
way except from “out front.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that the music was all stolen from
something else, for a composer, a rival of Philip
Noel, who had dropped in to chat with Gloria, had
said so; that in an effort to do something original
the costumer had produced frightful results, for
Terry Riordan had commented on it, and Billie
Irwin had spoken of how often the leading woman
flatted her notes. Her voice had been bad enough
when she started ten years ago, and now it was quite
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry Riordan had not spoken to Ruth since
their arrival, when he had pretended to be quite
overcome with the grandeur of her gown. Since
then he had devoted himself entirely to Gloria.
Ruth couldn’t blame him for that. Gloria made
every one else appear colourless. No wonder Terry
Riordan loved her. It was foolish of her to let him
occupy her thoughts. No man in his right mind
would give her a second thought in the presence of
Gloria. Even the thought that she was an art student
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>no longer brought comfort. There were so
many art students in New York. Still she could
not keep Terry out of her mind. It was not that
she thought him a genius. Indeed, she rather
scorned his slapstick lyrics. New York might bow
down before his frayed cuff cleverness, but she was
from the Middle West, where men are rated by
what they have done, not what they are going to
do. She couldn’t analyse exactly what it was about
Terry Riordan that stirred her emotions,—some
sympathetic quality in his voice perhaps, his never-failing
cheerfulness and his absolute confidence in
his own future. She was rather glad that he didn’t
talk to her very much, for she blushed whenever
he spoke to her. She had blushed when he spoke
about her frock and old John Courtney had commented
on it in his absurd exaggerated manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How charmingly you blush, Miss Mayfield,” he
had said. “You must pardon an old gentleman for
speaking of it, my dear, but I dare say it is the
only genuine blush that Broadway has seen these
forty years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If it had been possible to be annoyed by anything
the ancient matinée idol said, Ruth would have
been annoyed, especially as it momentarily attracted
the attention of every one to the party, to herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Courtney was another of Gloria’s admirers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The best actress in New York,” he whispered
to Ruth. “But she hasn’t had an engagement for
three years. She won’t take anything but leads, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>there isn’t a man who dares play opposite her. It’s
not alone that she’s so tall—though no man likes to
play opposite a woman from one to five inches
taller than he—it’s her personality. She fills the
stage. The other players are just so much background.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later even John Courtney seemed to forget the
existence of Ruth, and she sat back in the crowded
box in the crowded theatre quite alone. She could
not even watch the stage—for they had reduced the
people on it to a group of ordinary individuals
working at their trade. She had a little sketch pad
and a pencil with her and began making caricatures
of the principals. She became absorbed in this and
forgot to feel alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That nose is wonderful and that’s just her
trick with her hands. I didn’t know you were a
cartoonist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Terry Riordan looking over her shoulder.
She had not known he was in the box.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not a cartoonist,” she said, making an effort
to hide her sketch pad. “I was only doing it for
fun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they’re great; let me see the others. I had
no idea you were so talented. I thought you just
daubed around with paint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From any one else the words would have been
cruel enough, but from Terry Riordan they were
almost unbearable. She could hardly keep the tears
back.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“That isn’t talent,” she managed to articulate.
“It’s just facility. I am studying painting—I never
do this sort of thing seriously—I was just playing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had taken the sketches from her and was looking
at her in puzzled wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to say you don’t want to do this
sort of thing—that you consider it beneath your
talent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t interest me.” She spoke with as much
dignity as she could muster. For a moment he
looked troubled, then his irresistible smile came.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, I understand,” he said. “Ten
years ago I intended to be a modern Shakespeare—and
just see the awful end to which I’ve come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then the curtain went up, and she did not
notice that he had not returned her sketches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time Gloria had been the gayest person
there—so gay that Ruth thought that she had
forgotten her existence. She was in the chair in
front of Ruth, and had apparently been absorbed
in the play and the conversation of the people with
her. Suddenly she rose and left the box, pausing
just long enough to whisper in Ruth’s ear, “I’m
going home; Billie will explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The others in the box didn’t seem to notice. Perhaps
they thought Gloria had gone back stage to
see some friend and would return. It was only
when the final curtain fell and Terry came back to
ask them to go to supper that her absence was explained.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Where’s Gloria?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone home,” said Billie. “She asked me to
explain to you that she had to go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why?” asked Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because she wanted to—you know Gloria—sudden
fit of depression, because she isn’t working
and wants to work. Why don’t you write a play for
her, Terry?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will one day perhaps—if I can, but I so
wanted her tonight. Let’s follow her home and
drag her out again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if you value her friendship,” said Billie.
“Aren’t there enough of us here to make a supper
party?” She smiled coyly at him, shrugging her
plump shoulders and turning her pale eyes at him
in an ingénue ogle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course—we’ll try to be as merry as possible
without her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think if you’ll help me find a cab I’ll go
home to Gloria,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You too?” Terry looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d rather if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can’t allow you to go alone. I shall be
most happy,” said John Courtney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No indeed. I know that you don’t want to
miss a word of what they say about Terry’s play,
and I’d rather go alone. The others would never
forgive me for taking you away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After that it was easy for her to slip away into
the darkness and seclusion of a cab, alone with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>thousands in the checked thoroughfare. She wanted
to get away from Terry Riordan and his success.
She thought she was escaping for the same reason
that Gloria had run away, but Gloria could not be
as unhappy as she, for Gloria had had her success.
Terry Riordan knew that Gloria was a great actress,
but he didn’t know that she, Ruth Mayfield, was a
great painter, at least a potential great painter. He
had suggested that she was a cartoonist and he had
thought that he was paying her a compliment.
Years from now, when she became a beautiful,
fascinating woman of thirty like Gloria, even in
imagination she couldn’t make herself quite thirty-five—they
would meet again. It would be at a private
view at the Academy, and he would be standing
lost in wonder before the picture she would have
hung there. Every one would be talking about her
and her work, and then they would meet face to
face. There would be no condescension in his
words and smile then—</p>

<p class='c007'>She was imagining childish nonsense. By the
time she had won her success, Terry would be married
to Gloria. It was easy to see that he loved
Gloria. Why not? No one could be so beautiful
or so charming as Gloria. It was silly to dream of
Terry Riordan’s love, but she would win his admiration
and respect. After all, marriage had never
held any place in her plans. She didn’t want to
marry. She wanted to be a great painter. One
must make some sacrifices for that. The cab turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>into the great quiet of Gramercy Square. A soft
mist hung over the trees, like quiet tears of renunciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was startled to see lights gleaming in all the
lower windows of the house. Inside she found
George sitting on the lower step of the stairs. He
rose as she entered, but did not respond when she
spoke to him. The doors into the drawing-room
were open and she looked in. Lying face down on
the floor, still fully dressed, was Gloria and scattered
around her were the violets from the bouquet
she had been wearing. She was quite motionless,
and Ruth dared not speak to her. Evidently
George was keeping watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can I do anything?” she whispered to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head and pointed silently up the
stairs. She went, hurrying up the three flights as
if the act of going up lifted her above her own
discontent and above the unhappiness of Gloria.
She went into the studio and looked at the canvas
on which she had been working. It was hard to
wait until morning to begin on it again. It had
been a week since she had touched it. When she
began she had intended rising early to get an hour’s
work before breakfast, but evenings in the company
of Gloria and her friends had kept her up late and
youth claimed its need of rest despite her firmest
resolves. It was no good, the picture, anyway. She
would paint it all out and begin over again. She
would spend her Sundays in the country with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>other art students, sketching. She had not entered
into the student life enough. And she had entered
into Gloria’s life too much. If she had been taking
her work more seriously she would not have had
time to fall in love with Terry Riordan. She did
not question that it was love that had come into her
life to complicate things. In Indianapolis it had
all seemed so simple. There were paint and canvas
and her hands to work with, and she would study
and work and exhibit and become famous. Now it
was made plain to her that art itself was not a matter
of paint and canvas and exhibitions, or even of
work as Dorothy Winslow had said, but a matter
of men and women, and competition and struggle
and love and hate and jealousy and thwarted ambitions
like those of the woman who lay down there
prostrate with defeat. The defeat that was such a
tragic jest—a great talent useless because the actress
was too tall. If success was dependent on such
things as that of what use to struggle and work?
Crouched on the floor before her canvas she looked
up through the skylight at a star, and soft tears
moved slowly down her cheeks, tears for herself
and for Gloria and for all the unfruitful love and
labour in the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ever since her conversation with Dorothy
Winslow, Ruth had wondered whether it
would not be better if she had taken painting
and composition instead of portrait painting in the
morning. But she didn’t like to give up the portrait
painting and she knew that if she suggested attending
one of the evening classes Gloria would object
that she was working too hard. Of course she was
her own mistress, but it wasn’t pleasant to meet with
opposition nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c007'>She spoke to Dorothy about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t get everything in a year, and it all
counts. I don’t think one can tell exactly what one’s
forte is until one has studied for some time. Better
keep on as you are. Certainly don’t give up the portrait
class. Bridgelow is wonderful,” Dorothy had
assured her, “and you may not get a chance to
study under him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to Ruth that she was living a sort of
double life, her hours among the art students were
so separate from her life with the people at the
house on Gramercy Square. And in a way she was
not actually a part of either life. Among the students
she felt a certain reticence, because they were
most of them, at least the ones she had met, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>obviously poor. They were paying their own way
by working at things far removed from art. One
of the girls painted stereopticon slides for illustrated
songs, and some of the boys worked at night as
waiters. They lived in studios and cooked their own
meals, and Ruth was ashamed to let them know
exactly where or how she lived. She heard their
chatter of parties to which she had not been invited,
and she could not control the feeling that she was
inferior to these people because she had an assured
income.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning following the opening of Terry
Riordan’s play Ruth had left the house without seeing
Gloria, and the thought of her aunt as she had
last seen her, was with her all morning. In the
brief time between classes she was glad to join the
group of students who always hurried to a little
restaurant on Eighth Avenue for a bite of lunch, or
a “bolt of lunch” as Nels Zord called it. Nels
was a Norwegian, possibly twenty-five years old
who spent every other year studying. He was supposed
to have a great amount of talent and he sometimes
sold things—seascapes mostly, small canvases
of a delicacy that seemed incredible in view
of his huge, thick hands. When he was not in
New York, he went on long voyages as a sailor
before the mast, where he satisfied his muscles with
hard work and his soul with adventure and gathered
material to be painted from half finished
sketches and from memory when he returned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>New York. He had gone to sea first as a boy of
fifteen, from his home in Seattle and always chose
sailing vessels from preference. He had two passions,
art and food, and had never yet been known
to give a girl anything but the most comradely attentions,
which was, perhaps, why he was so much
sought after by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth, Dorothy, and Nels walked together to the
lunch room. All of the students were talking about
the water colour show that was to open at the
Academy the following Tuesday. On Monday
evening there was to be a private view, and Nels
Zord, by virtue of being an exhibitor was one of the
few students who would be admitted. He was permitted
one guest and had surprised every one by
inviting Dorothy Winslow. She told the news to
Ruth as they walked along.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t,” said Nels with what seemed to Ruth
unnecessary rudeness. “You invited yourself, and
I hadn’t asked any one else. Might as well take
you as any one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Far be it from me to care how I get there,”
said Dorothy with perfect good nature. “It’s a
shame that Ruth can’t go too. You’ve never been
to a private view at a big show like this, have you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, and I’d love to go, but I suppose there’s
no chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll tell you what; I think I know how you can
get it,” said Nels. “I know a chap, old fellow, one
of the patrons. He always goes and he’s always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>alone. I don’t see why he wouldn’t take you—he’s
not one of those old birds who goes in for
young girls—not old enough I guess—and you’re
quiet looking and everything. You know he ought
to be proud to take you,” he ended up in what was
for him a burst of enthusiasm, but Ruth was rather
inclined to be offended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, I’d much rather not go than to go in
that way—” she began explaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now don’t be foolish,” interrupted Dorothy.
“You know that any one of us will go in any way
possible. It doesn’t matter how we get there so
long as we do get there. At the private view we’ll
have a chance to really see the pictures and to hear
the criticisms of the people whose opinion counts.
Do be sensible and come with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I want to go, just as all of us do,”
admitted Ruth, “but not badly enough to go as the
unwelcome guest of a man I’ve never met.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t understand,” said Nels. “He won’t
be taking you there, exactly. It’s just this way.
He’s allowed one guest, I’ve never known him to
bring one. Some one might just as well use that
guest card. He’s a friend of mine and I’ll ask him
for it. If it’s necessary for him to appear with you,
we can all meet at the Academy. By the way, a private
view is awfully dressy—have you got evening
things?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth wasn’t surprised at the question. She knew
that lots of the students considered themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>lucky to possess one costume suitable for the street.
She knew two girls who shared a studio and one
evening gown together. They wore the gown turn
about, and couldn’t both accept an invitation to the
same party. Knowing these things she nodded
without comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, she has everything,” explained
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I haven’t you know—always put on my
Latin quartier clothes, things I never dared wear in
Paris, but they go big enough here, especially when
worn by an exhibitor,” said Nels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what I shall wear—probably borrow
a frock from some one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you—do you think you could wear one
of mine?” asked Ruth hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“D’you mean to say you’ve got two?” asked
Dorothy with mock amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you think it can be arranged without too
much trouble, I would like to go,” admitted
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Simplest thing in the world,” said Nels who was
rather proud of his influential friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation about the water colour show
drove thoughts of Gloria out of Ruth’s mind until
she started homeward from the League. She wondered
how Gloria would look, whether she would
dare speak of the happening of the night before,
whether Gloria would be shut in her own room and
refuse to see her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Gloria’s voice called joyously to her as she opened
the door. She was standing in the midst of innumerable
garments, frocks, hats, shoes, lingerie,
gloves, all in a state of wild confusion, while George
dragged huge trunks into the few empty spaces on
the floor, and Amy stood by, trying to fold and
classify garments as Gloria threw them about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to Palm Beach—want to come
along?” she called cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t very well leave school, Gloria, but if
you want to close the house I can go to an hotel
for a few weeks. How long are you going to be
gone—when are you going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. I just know I’ve got to get away
for a while. I hate New York. I’m going as soon
as I can get packed, but there’s no reason for closing
the house. You’re here and Billie will be here
at least until she gets an engagement, and I’ll leave
George and Amy. I just thought if you wanted to
come you might.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I’d love to go; I’ve never been to
Florida, but I can’t leave school just now. Can I
help?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dive in; the sooner the trunks are packed the
sooner I go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you bought a ticket and made reservations?”
asked Ruth practically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Time enough for that later. I can’t go today
anyway you know. I just thought of it an hour
ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“If Miss Mayfield will pardon a suggestion from
me,” said George, “I would suggest that Palm
Beach will be very dull just now—It is too early
for the season to have begun and the hotels will be
quite deserted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just why I’m going—I’m fed up with
people,” said Gloria, and George subsided into sullen
silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the few things about Gloria that Ruth did
not quite like was her treatment of her servants.
She was quite as apt to ask the advice of George or
Amy as one of her friends, and in consequence they
often offered it unsolicited. With Amy this course
was all right. She would storm and scold in true
Southern negro fashion and take the resulting scolding
in good part, but if Gloria reprimanded George
he would retire sullenly to the lower regions of the
house and pack his luggage and then appear with
great dignity to offer his resignation. Whereupon
Gloria would beg him to stay and he would consent
to do so with apparent reluctance. Once Ruth had
seen her put her hand on his arm with a familiar
gesture while she pleaded with him to stay. The
sight sent a cold shudder over her. To Ruth there
was something sinister and repulsive about George,
and she was almost sure that her feeling of distrust
and dislike was fully returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went out now in answer to the ringing door
bell, and returned with Terry Riordan, who stood
looking in with wide, questioning eyes. Ruth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>watched his face intently, keen to see whether he
would show regret at Gloria’s going away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Glad I got here in time to say good-bye,” he
said, smiling. “Who’s going away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought George told you over the ’phone that
I couldn’t see any one today,” said Gloria. “I’m
packing to go to Palm Beach, and now that
you’ve satisfied your curiosity, perhaps you’ll run
along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all; I’m going to stay to argue with
you. In the first place why go away and in the
second why go to Palm Beach when there are so
many interesting places to go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going away because I’m tired of playwrights
and actors and actresses, and Fifth Avenue
and Broadway, and if you have any better place
than Palm Beach to suggest, I will be very glad to
go there—only don’t say the North Pole, for I’ve
been packing summer clothing and don’t want to do
it all over again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t you say anything to her?” he asked, smiling
at Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>She shook her head, answering him with her eyes
and again she had the feeling of a secret understanding
between herself and Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t you any control over this house,
George?” he asked perching on top of one of the
trunks and lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>George made no answer, but Amy grinned her
delight. With her mistress gone George would assume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>more upper servant airs than ever and she
would have no court of justice to which she could
refer in time of domestic strife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please get off that trunk, Terry; there are chairs
to sit on,” said Gloria, drawing the red flower of
her lip under her white teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can I sit on a chair when there are hats
and boots on every one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, I’ll clear one for you,” said Gloria, and
sent a hat sailing across the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth would never dare throw a hat across the
room, no matter how much she felt like it. She
watched Gloria in a perfect passion of admiration
that half drowned the sharp pain in her heart because
she knew that Terry also saw Gloria’s beauty
and felt the charm of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you really must go away, and I can understand
that too, for I’d like to get away myself,
why not take a sea voyage—that’s the real thing
in rest cures. Go to San Francisco by rail and then
take one of those boats that run to Hawaii and
Samoa and on to Sydney if you don’t want to stop
at Samoa. Let me see, five days to San Francisco,
eighteen days to Sydney, not counting a long stopover
in Hawaii and Samoa, and by the time you return
I’ll have a comedy written for you,—a comedy
in which the entire plot rests on the heroine’s being
not less than six feet tall—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t tease me, Terry—it isn’t fair—you’ve
been writing that comedy for three years now—if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>you only would write it I wouldn’t care even if I
had to play opposite a giant from a circus—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was near tears, so near that Ruth could hardly
restrain an impulse to go to her and throw her arms
about her, when Terry evidently with the same impulse
went to her and did throw one arm about her
shoulders. Ruth saw now that they were exactly
the same height.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear girl, I’m not teasing. The comedy is
half finished now, only I wanted to keep it for a
surprise, and you won’t play opposite a circus giant.
If necessary I’ll play opposite you myself and wear
French heels.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t believe him, Ruth,” said Gloria, smiling
now. “He’s always promising to write a comedy
for me, but he doesn’t mean it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait and see,” said Terry. “You do believe
me, don’t you Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Ruth, gazing hopelessly on the splendid
beauty of her aunt, and seeing Terry’s arm across
her shoulder could not answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give you four weeks more to make good,
Terry,” said Gloria. “Clear all the junk away,
George; I’ve changed my mind. I’m not going
away for a while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry Riordan forebore to laugh, but his eyes
again sought Ruth’s in secret understanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll go up and work a while before dinner,”
she said. It was better to leave them alone,
and she must work! she must work! she must work!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Pursuant to her conversation with Dorothy
Winslow in which she had announced her intention
of painting landscapes with figures, Ruth had begun
a new canvas—a corner of the park with two children
playing under the trees. She had been trying
to get an effect of sunlight falling through green
leaves. It was badly done. She could see that now.
Besides, she didn’t want to paint children. She
painted them out with great sweeps of her brush.
They were stiff, horrid, complacent little creatures.
Instead she would have only one figure, a shabby,
old woman crouching on a park bench, and she
would take out the sunlight too. A thin mist of
rain would be falling and the sky would be murky
with a faint, coppery glow where the sun sought to
penetrate through the clouds, but the chief interest
of the picture would centre about the figure of the
old woman, holding her tattered cloak about her
under the uncertain shelter of the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>If only she had the colour sense of Nels Zord—she
would get it in time. It was only a question
of more work and more work. Would Terry
Riordan really play opposite Gloria in the new
comedy? The play was the task that Gloria had set
him and when it was produced Terry could claim
his reward. She would go to the wedding and no
one would ever guess that her heart was broken.
Afterward she would live in retirement and paint;
or perhaps she would travel and one day be thirty-five
years old and beautiful with a strange, sad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>beauty and men would love her, but she would refuse
them all ever so gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>She worked steadily for almost an hour and then
she began to wonder whether Amy would have a
very good dinner and how many would be there.
Perhaps Terry Riordan would stay. And she decided
to put on a new dinner frock that she had
bought and wondered if she could dress her hair as
Gloria did, and tried it, but found it unsuccessful
and reverted to her own simple coiffure.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she went down she found that Terry had
indeed stayed for dinner and Gloria had changed to
a gorgeous gown and Billie Irwin, who had come
in late from the hair-dresser’s, had acquired a
splendid aureole of golden hair in place of the
streaked blond of yesterday, and Philip Noel was
trying out some new music and they had all promised
to stay to dinner and afterward there was a
play that they simply must see, at least the second
act. There was really nothing worth listening to
after the second act, and all conversation about
going away or about the new comedy seemed to be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have a surprise on Sunday morning,”
Terry told her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What kind of a surprise?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t tell now; it’s a secret. Gloria knows,
though.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a very nice surprise,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth glanced quickly from one to the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Perhaps they were going to be married and would
announce the fact on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t I guess?” she asked, trying to imitate
their gay mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! you’d never guess,” said Gloria, “but it’s
really a wonderful surprise. Only you mustn’t
ask questions—you’ll find out at breakfast Sunday
morning and not a moment sooner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Sunday breakfast was a ceremony at the
house on Gramercy Square. Then Gloria
broke away from her rule of breakfast in
bed, and clad in the most alluring of French
negligées, she presided at the coffee urn in the big
dining-room, while around her were ranged friends
expected and unexpected in harmonious Sunday
comfort. There was a delightful untidiness about
the entire room that was particularly cheering—ash
trays with half-smoked cigarettes on the white cloth
and Sunday newspapers scattered at random by
casual hands. Conversation for the first half hour
was confined to nods and sleepy smiles, but when
the second cup of coffee had been poured people
really began to talk. There was always, when the
weather permitted, a fire in the grate, and after
breakfast there was an hour of intimate chat in
which all the stage gossip of the season was told
and analysed, and careers were made and unmade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfast was at eleven o’clock, but Ruth had
been up for hours, working away in her studio at
the top of the house. At eleven she came down,
for George was intolerant of late comers. Gloria,
Billie Irwin, Terry Riordan, and John Courtney
were already there. They raised their heads from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>their newspapers and greeted her with smiles, for
Gloria considered it the worst taste possible for
any one to speak before she had had her first cup
of coffee, and particularly she disliked “Good morning”
spoken in a cheery tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no such thing as a good morning,” she
always averred. “Morning is never good, except
for sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the moment that Ruth entered George placed
the coffee urn on the table and Gloria proceeded to
pour the cups, looking very lovely with the dusk of
sleep still in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth thought it very odd to be at a table with
four other people none of whom spoke a word. No
one else seemed to mind, they all devoted themselves
to their breakfast with the same earnestness
that a few moments before had been bestowed on
the Sunday newspapers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Terry, you can give Ruth her surprise,”
said Gloria presently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth had almost forgotten but now she remembered,
seeing them all look at her beamingly, as if
she had done something very nice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry reached down to the floor and picked up a
section of newspaper. It was the theatrical section,
Ruth saw, even before he handed it to her, and
then, that it contained a story about “Three Merry
Men,” with a photograph of the leading woman and
grouped around it the sketches that Ruth had made
caricaturing the players. The sketches had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>been signed but under them was a printed caption,
“Sketched by Ruth Mayfield.” She stared at the
page for some moments, realizing that they were
all looking at her and expecting some sort of an outburst.
Finally when she sat silent, Billie Irwin, less
sensitive than the others, spoke:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t it wonderful, Ruth—we’re all so proud
and glad for you—to think of seeing your work reproduced,
and you’ve only been in New York a few
weeks.” She put her plump hand on Ruth’s shoulder
with an impulsive gesture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth restrained an impulse to throw it off. She
still kept her head bent, instinctively hiding her eyes
until she should gain control of their expression.
She realized that every one there thought that
Terry had done a fine thing in getting the sketches
printed, that Terry himself thought he had done a
nice thing. It would be impossible to explain to
these people that she considered such work beneath
her—that she, the future great painter, did not
want to dabble in cartooning. But to them she was
only an obscure art student. She must say something
soon—her silence was past the limit of surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How good of you, Mr. Riordan,” she said at
last. “I had no idea that you were going to do this
when you took my sketches. It’s quite wonderful
to see them—to see them in a newspaper like
this—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My word,” laughed Terry, “I believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Ruth doesn’t really like it at all, though I meant
well, I did indeed, child, and though you don’t know
it, cartooning is quite as much art as painting, and
quite as difficult if one had not the particular genius
for it. I gave the sketches to the <cite>Sun</cite> critic and he
was quite enthusiastic. I dare say you might get
a chance to do it right along if you wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ruth is an ungrateful little wretch if she isn’t
both pleased and proud,” said Gloria, smiling fondly
at Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am pleased and grateful,” protested Ruth,
“but I don’t want to be a cartoonist, not until I’m
quite sure that I can never be a painter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better far be a clever cartoonist than a bad
painter,” said John Courtney, “though I understand
just how you feel. As a young man, when I first
entered the profession I wanted to be a great
comedian—I still think I could have been one, for
I have a keen sense of humour, but it was not to be,
I was, you will pardon me for speaking of it, I was
too handsome—my appearance forced me to be a
romantic hero—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He passed one white hand over his grey, curled
hair, as he spoke, with a gesture as one who should
say, “you can see that I am still handsome and can
judge for yourselves of my youth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your fatal beauty was your ruin,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>He smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not my ruin, I have done very well, but I
did want to be a great comedian, and I’ve never seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>a comedian who did not secretly long for tragic
rôles, but ‘there is a destiny that shapes our
ends—’ What is that quotation?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Rough-hew them as we will,’” Ruth finished
for him. “I quoted that myself to a girl last week
and she answered me by saying that she intended
to do a lot of rough-hewing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, even if you do want to paint I think you
ought to follow this newspaper thing up,” said
Billie Irwin who was a bit vague as to the trend
of the conversation. “Your name is in quite large
type and nothing counts like keeping one’s name before
the public. If only I had not been so retiring
when I first started!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just here George came in with a letter which he
laid beside Ruth’s plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It just came by hand,” he explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth lost no time in opening the large, square
envelope, addressed in a precise, old-fashioned,
masculine hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside was a square engraved card of admission
to the private view of the water colour show at the
Academy on Monday evening. With it was another
card with the name Professor Percival Pendragon
engraved on it, and the words “compliments of”
written above.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, isn’t this splendid!” she exclaimed, passing
the contents of the envelope to Gloria. “You know
all of the students are crazy to go to the private
view tomorrow night, but it’s awfully exclusive and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>only the members of the Academy and the exhibitors
have cards, but each one is permitted one
guest. Nels Zord, one of the student exhibitors is
taking Dorothy Winslow and he’s asked this man,
a friend and patron of his, to send me his guest
card. Hasn’t he got a queer name? You know
I’ve never met him at all. He must be really fond
of Nels—quite an old chap I suppose and perhaps
I’ll meet him at—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then Ruth was stopped by the expression on
Gloria’s face. She was holding the card away from
her as if it were something dangerous and her face
had grown quite pale, her big, blue eyes staring out
with an expression that Ruth could not analyse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it—are you ill?” In her fright Ruth
has risen from her place at the table and moved to
Gloria’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria waved her away with a movement of her
arm, and seeming to recover a part of her composure
began to smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s nothing at all, Ruth,” she said. “I was
just startled for a moment—you see Professor Percival
Pendragon is—was, my husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth sank back into her chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I suppose—perhaps you’d prefer—I can
send the card back to him and tell that I am unable
to use it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all,” said Gloria, twisting her round, red
mouth in the whimsical way she had. “If you
haven’t met him he doesn’t know that you are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>relative of mine and you needn’t tell. Besides he’s
an awfully good sort really. I always did like
Percy. I didn’t know he was in America. The last
I knew he was in Oxford, associated with the observatory
there. He’ll probably talk to you about
the great star map.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The great star map?” questioned Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t know what the thing really is,” said
Gloria. “Something that the astronomers are
working on now. It takes about twenty years to
make one, but it’s no particular use to them after
it’s finished. They just make it with great work—but
that’s merely a rehearsal. Their children make
another one, which I suppose is the dress rehearsal;
and their grandchildren make a third, which is I
suppose the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première</span></i>. Then they compare their
map with the one made by their parents and grandparents
and by some process discover that the
planets have moved. They have a wild hope that
they may discover where the planets have moved
and why, but if that doesn’t materialize the great-grandchildren’s
children make a new star map, devoting
their entire lives to it, and some time, two
thousand years from now, perhaps, some grey-whiskered
old man some place will know something
exact about the stars, or will not know something
exact about the stars, as the case may be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one except Ruth laughed at this description.
She felt that these people with all their years
must be in some ways younger than herself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“They are working for posterity,” she said reprovingly.
“All great art and science is like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but you mustn’t expect player folk to appreciate
anything but the transitory in art,” said
John Courtney. “It is the tragedy of the profession
that the art of every one of us dies with us. The
tones of Gloria’s marvellous speaking voice will not
be heard by our descendants. Booth is nothing but
a memory in spite of his statue out there in the park.
It is the life of a butterfly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Courtney had used his deepest emotional voice
in speaking, and despite custom and knowledge of
his many harmless affectations, Billie Irwin shuddered
and looked pained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Butterflies are very beautiful at least,” said
Terry, reflecting in his face the concern that Ruth
also felt as she noted that Gloria was still looking
quite pale, with a strained expression in her eyes as
if she were seeing things far removed from the
breakfast room. She determined to again ask her
aunt if it would not be better to give up the private
view, as soon as she had an opportunity to speak
with her alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opportunity did not come until late that afternoon,
and then Gloria shrugged her shoulders in
a careless manner and laughed at Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not, foolish child. He doesn’t know
that you live with me. I doubt if he even knows
that I am alive. I’ve been off the stage so long and
besides he never goes to the theatre. This art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>thing must be a new fad with him. Still he must
have noticed the name. Even Percy can scarcely
have forgotten my last name. Only don’t tell him
about me. Don’t let him know that you are a relative,
and don’t let him come to the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The others are coming—Dorothy and Nels.
I’m going to lend Dorothy a gown.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do they know anything about me?” asked
Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; you see I’ve been afraid to tell them just
how happily I am situated. They are all so poor
and I’ve been afraid that they’d not take me seriously
if I told them that I have never been hungry
or afraid of a landlord or any of the interesting
things that seem to be common in their lives. They
rather look down on the students that have an allowance
from home, so I’ve never told them anything
about myself. Probably I shan’t meet Mr.
Pendragon at all. If he had wanted to meet me
he would have come with Nels instead of sending
the admission card, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then curiosity overcoming delicacy, Ruth asked
her the question that had been in her mind all day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which one is Professor Pendragon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which one?” Gloria’s eyebrows went up in
surprise. “Oh yes, I know what you mean, which
one on my list. Percy was number one. I was very
young when I married Percy and very ambitious.
It was—let me see—eleven years ago and we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>married just one year. I haven’t seen him for nine
years or heard of him for at least five, and if you
love me, Ruth, you won’t let him know who you
are or you won’t mention me. You see I’ve been
married twice since then and I don’t want to meet
Percy. It would be painful to both of us. He can’t
have any interest in me, and certainly l have none
in him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice grew hard as she spoke the last words
and her mouth set in a line that made her lips look
almost thin, but her eyes were not hard. Some deep
emotion looked out of them, but whether it was pain
or hate, Ruth could not decide.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could understand that Gloria would be embarrassed
at seeing her first husband, especially in
view of the fact that he had had two successors,
and that Gloria was contemplating a fourth marriage.
As Ruth’s own admiration for Terry Riordan
increased she found it increasingly difficult to believe
that Gloria would reject him, so the fourth
marriage seemed quite possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria was going to dine out that night and they
were together in her room where she was dressing.
Her auburn hair fell over her shoulders and Ruth
decided that now she looked like the pictures of
Guinevere in “The Idylls of the King.” Ruth knew
that Gloria had been disturbed by the knowledge
that her former husband was in New York and that
she might meet him at any time, but she did not
seem to be averse to talking about it, and Ruth was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>one of those persons, who, seemingly shy and reserved,
actually so about her own affairs, could yet
ask with impunity, questions that from any other
person would have seemed prying and almost impertinent.
This was really because Ruth never
asked out of idle curiosity, but because she had a real
interest. Her aunt was to her a fascinating book,
the pages of which she must turn and turn until she
had read the entire story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had any of the people this morning ever met
Professor Pendragon?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; that is no one but George—I acquired
George in London, you know, just about the same
time that I married Percy. Husbands come and husbands
go, but a good servant is not so easily replaced,
so I’ve managed to keep George, though he
hates New York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then,” continued Ruth, more to herself than to
Gloria, “it was not Professor Pendragon who gave
you this house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, as I told you, I don’t think he even knows
that I’m in New York. I didn’t know he was here.
I was fond of Percy and naturally I don’t let him
give me anything, because that would have given him
pleasure and I wanted to hurt him—”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mirror she caught the shocked expression
in Ruth’s eyes, and turned swiftly to face her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you think all this is terrible, but after
a few years you’ll understand, not me, but something
of life itself and of how helpless we all are.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>I know that you have a very clearly defined plan of
life—certain things that you will do—certain things
that ‘could never happen to me.’ I know because
we’re all like that. And then one day, utterly without
your own volition, knowing that you’re doing
the wrong thing, you’ll do and say things that simply
aren’t written in your lines. Do you suppose that at
your age I planned to love a human observatory that
observed everything except me, or that I expected
to divorce him and marry a tired business man who
expected to use me as a perpetual advertisement for
toilet preparations, or that I expected when I
divorced him that I’d do it all over again with a man
more lifeless than his family portraits? You don’t
know what you’re going to do when you start out.
I know just that much now—that I don’t know. I
may commit matrimony again tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But didn’t you love any of these men?” gasped
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course—I loved Percy, and Percy loved the
stars—perhaps that’s why he married me. I was
a star of a kind at the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t know; I think the final break came
because of Eros— Isn’t that the bell? Do run and
tell Terry that I’ll be with him in a minute. I
wonder why he will persist in always being on
time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Terry. He was trying to engage the dignified
George in conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Hello—you look as if you’d been reading fairy
tales,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, just talking to Gloria,” said Ruth. “She’ll
be down in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been an exciting conversation from
the size of your young eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were talking,” said Ruth, “we were talking
about—about Eros.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The God of Love?” asked Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will pardon me,” said George, “Eros is
also the name of a small planet discovered in our
solar system in the year 1898.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Completing which amazing piece of information,
George silently departed, leaving the two staring
after him.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth had intended asking permission to have
Dorothy and Nels to dinner on the night of
the private view, but if she did that they
would learn that her aunt was Gloria Mayfield and
there was every chance that Nels would refer to that
fact in talking to Professor Pendragon, for Ruth
had already discovered that the art students were
ardent celebrity seekers and Gloria Mayfield, though
she had not appeared on any stage for three seasons,
was still something of a celebrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>She compromised by eating an early dinner with
Dorothy at the little restaurant on Eighth Avenue,
at least Dorothy called it dinner, though it was
eaten at tea time and both girls were too excited to
care what they ate. Then they went home to dress.
It was the first time that Ruth had taken any one
of the students to her house and she wondered just
how she would avoid telling Dorothy about her
aunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>George opened the door for them and they went
on up to Ruth’s room without seeing any one else,
though Ruth could hear voices from the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This doesn’t look like a rooming house,” said
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“It isn’t. I live here with friends. What do
you think of my work room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great!—warm, too. There isn’t any heat
where I live and I have to use a little oil stove, but
it’s expensive. You know I don’t think much of
that—one might as well be frank—” She was looking
at the canvas Ruth had on her easel. “Nels
and I were talking about it yesterday. We think
you ought to follow up the cartoon thing. You
know they make a lot of money, cartoonists. You
could take it up seriously, you know—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t want to take it up seriously. I don’t
want to be a cartoonist. I want to be a landscape
painter, and if you will allow me to be frank, too,
I don’t think that you are in a position to judge
whether I have talent or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth had been very much surprised to find that
her friends at school seemed to think that she had
achieved something by having her sketches in a Sunday
newspaper. What she had thought would make
her lose caste among them had in reality given her
distinction, but it had had another effect also. If
she was a caricaturist she could also be a painter,
they reasoned, and less frankly than Dorothy, Nels
Zord had expressed the opinion that she would never
be a great painter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better be a successful cartoonist than an unsuccessful
painter,” he had said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had made no protest until now and Dorothy
looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Don’t be angry. I didn’t mean anything, only
it’s always a pity when any one has a real talent and
then insists on some other method of expression. Of
course you may be a great painter. As you say, I’m
not a critic and besides you haven’t been studying
long. Only the painting is all a gamble and the
sketches are a success right now if you care to go on
with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So are your fashions if you care to go on with
them,” said Ruth, still hurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speaking of fashions, let me see the frock I’m
to wear,” said Dorothy, changing the subject with
more abruptness than skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re in my other room,” said Ruth. “You
can have anything you want except what I’m going
to wear myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then followed two hours of dressing and redressing.
There were only two gowns to choose from,
but Dorothy had to try both of them many times,
rearranging her bobbed hair each time, and finally
deciding on the blue one because “it makes my eyes
so lovely and Nels is crazy about that blue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was so interested in her own appearance that
she forgot to ask questions about the friends with
whom Ruth lived and long before Nels called for
them, Ruth knew that Gloria would have gone out
for she was dining with the Peyton-Russells. Mrs.
Peyton-Russell had been a chorus girl who after she
married John Peyton-Russell had the good taste to
remember that Gloria Mayfield had befriended her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the result being that Gloria was often invited to
dinner parties at their place in town and had a
standing invitation to whatever country place happened
to be housing the Peyton-Russells, all invitations
that Gloria often accepted, though she complained
that Angela Peyton-Russell took her new
position far more seriously than she had ever taken
her profession. She was almost painfully respectable
and correct. She dressed more plainly than a grand
duchess, and having no children, was making strenuous
efforts to break into public work. One of the
most amusing of her activities, at least to Gloria,
was in connection with a drama uplift movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nels Zord came promptly at half-past eight,
dressed as he had threatened, “like a musical comedy
art student.” His wide trousers, short velvet
jacket and flowing tie created in the mind of Ruth
much the same wonder that Dorothy’s unaccustomed
elegance created in the mind of Nels. Only Dorothy
herself was unimpressed by their combined magnificence.
To her everything was but a stepping
stone on the upward path of her career.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t I look spiffy, Nels? And aren’t you going
to make sure that I meet Professor Pendragon, and
be sure and tell him that I do portraits and then I’ll
do the rest. If one can’t make use of one’s friends,
of whom can one make use?” The last addressed
to Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t miss the opportunity of letting him
meet you for anything,” agreed Nels. “Only do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>try and be a little bit careful, Dot, you are strenuous,
you know. Anyway you’d have met him without
asking. He seemed curious to meet Ruth. Asked
how she looked and if she was tall and beautiful,
and seemed awfully disappointed when I told him
that she was only short and pretty. Are you all
ready? There’s the cab waiting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From somewhere George appeared to open the
door for them, and as Ruth paused to wrap her cloak
more closely about her bare shoulders, his soft, lisping
voice whispered in her ear:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take care what you say to Pendragon, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She nodded and followed Nels and Dorothy into
the cold, outer air. In the cab Nels and Dorothy
chatted of the exhibitors—great artists whom they
knew by sight, while Ruth to whom they were only
names, listened in breathless admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had arrived and had left off their
wraps, Dorothy protested:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do we have to go down the line, or can we duck
to the left?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No nonsense like that; remember you’re with
an exhibitor, and besides Professor Pendragon may
be waiting for us. We can pay for the privilege of
looking at the pictures by breaking through the line
of receiving dowagers. It’s only fair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, very well—but it’s really awful, Ruth. Lots
of the students just duck the line and slip in at the
left, but I suppose we’re too dignified tonight.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Professor Pendragon was not waiting for them,
but the long line of dowagers was. If Dorothy had
not been with her, Ruth would merely have looked
at them as a long line of middle aged and elderly
women in evening dress, but Dorothy saw them with
far different eyes. She knew the names of some of
them, and whispered them to Ruth while they waited
to follow some people who had arrived before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just look at the third one from the end—the
one with the Valeska Suratt make-up on the Miss
Hazy frame—”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then Ruth looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know Miss Hazy in ‘Mrs. Wiggs of the
Cabbage Patch’—I say, wouldn’t you think she’d
choke with all those beads—the one with the neck
like a turtle. The ones with the antique
jewelry are from Philadelphia—you can tell them
with their evening cloaks on, too. They always have
evening cloaks made out of some grand, old piece
of tapestry taken from the top of the piano—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Nels led them forward and in a very few
seconds they had passed the line of patronesses, thin
and stout, there seemed to be no intermediates, and
were free to look at the pictures and talk to their
friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not for the world would Nels have dashed immediately
to his own picture, though he knew to a
fraction of an inch just where it was hung. But
gradually they went to it, hung on the eye line and
in the honour room, and there the three stood, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>girls telling Nels how proud they were, and Nels,
gratified at their praise, yet half fearing that some
one would overhear, with the blood coming and
going in his blond face until he looked like a girl
despite his heavy shoulders and the big hands that
looked more fitted for handling bricks than for painting
delicate seascapes in water colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other people seeing their interest in the picture
came and looked at it also. The “outsiders,” as
Dorothy called them, standing up as close as their
lorgnettes would permit, the artists, standing far
off and closing one eye in absurd postures, while
murmurs of “atmosphere,” “divine colour,” and
other phrases and words entered the pink ears of
Nels like incense in the nostrils of a god.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much engrossed was he in his little ceremony
of success that he did not see Professor Pendragon
approaching, though Dorothy and Ruth, without
knowing his identity, were both conscious that the
very tall, distinguished looking man was watching
them, Ruth even guessed who he was before he laid
his hand on Nels’ shoulder and spoke. It was not
alone that he was tall—very tall even with the slight
stoop with which he carried his shoulders; it was his
face that first attracted Ruth’s attention, a keen,
dark face with a high bridged nose and eyes from
which a flame of perpetual youth seemed to flash.
Yet it was a lined face, too, full of unexpected
laugh wrinkles and creases and there were streaks
of grey in the hair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Well, Nels, you can’t complain of how the picture
was hung this time.” His voice was like his
face, poetic and with a hidden laugh in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nels turned, flushing redder than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Pendragon, we’ve been looking for
you. I knew you’d turn up here sooner or later and
just waited. Here is Dot, I mean Miss Winslow,
and Miss Mayfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you so much for letting me use your
guest card. It was very kind of you, Professor
Pendragon, and I’m having such a good time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all! I was delighted to be able to make
such good use of it. Have you seen Alice Schille’s
children or Mary Cassatt’s charming pastel? The
women artists are rather outshining the men this
year. If Nels can break away from his own work
we’ll go and see them. Then there’s John Sloan and
Steinlen, and a Breckenridge thing with wonderful
colour.” He led them off, smiling down with a funny
little stooping movement of his head that in a smaller
man might have been described as birdlike. He
seemed to know every one and was continually being
stopped by men and women who wanted his opinion
about this or that piece of work. Ruth tried hard
to look at the pictures, but her mind was continually
wandering to the people and especially to Professor
Pendragon. Dorothy noticed this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t try to look at things tonight. None of
us ever do. The people are too funny. The dragon
seems to be on intimate terms with all of them,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>whispered. “Nels tells me that he’s a great swell
with ever so much money. I wish you could mention
that I paint portraits. If I could get him to sit it
would be a start. You mention portraits and I’ll
do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Much embarrassed and in great fear that
Dorothy’s whispers would be overheard, Ruth tried
to make an opportunity for mentioning that Dorothy
painted portraits. Professor Pendragon himself
made it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of work are you doing, Miss Mayfield?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing now, I’m just a student, but I hope to
do landscapes. Dorothy is to be a great portrait
painter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I’d love to paint you, Professor
Pendragon. You have such an interesting face—you
have really,” she ended as Nels laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some day when I have lots of time—and thank
you for saying that my face is interesting! Or perhaps
I can do even better and get some beautiful
woman to sit for you. Wouldn’t you like that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I’d rather have you,” said Dorothy, raising
her large blue eyes with ingenuous confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s a very interesting picture in the
‘morgue,’ by a new artist of course, that I’d like to
have you see, Nels.” He broke off, for Nels had
been drawn away by some fellow students and
Dorothy had followed him, leaving him alone with
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“Never mind; perhaps you’ll be interested, Miss
Mayfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth thought she detected the faintest trace of
hesitancy in his voice whenever he pronounced her
name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is New York your home?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is now. I came from Indiana, but my mother
died a few months ago and I am living with friends
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How sad; you have no relatives then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes were searching her face and she felt
that he must see that she was lying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you paint?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, this art thing is a new fad with me—that
is of course I’ve always been interested in beautiful
things, but it’s only recently that I’ve been actively
interested. I’m afraid I’m a dilettante—rather an
awkward confession for a man of forty-one to make,
but it’s true. I thought I had a career as an astronomer,
but I gave that up some years ago, and
since then I’ve tried a bit of everything. One must
play some sort of game, you know. It must be wonderful
to be like that little girl with Nels. Her
game will be earning a living for some time to
come—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another pause gave Ruth a clue to his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I’m not exactly in that position—of course
I want to earn money, too, but only because that is
the world’s stamp of success,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>He had evidently forgotten the picture they went
to see, for he asked her if she was hungry, and when
she said “No,—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought young things were always hungry,
especially art students, but if you’re not hungry let’s
sit here and talk. Nels and Miss Winslow will be
sure to find us soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Astronomy must be an awfully interesting
study,” she said, wondering how any man once having
married Gloria could ever have let her go, and
why Gloria once having loved a man like this, could
ever have sent him away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, interesting, but like art it is very long.
I sometimes think I would have done better to take
up astrology.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re joking,” said Ruth. “Surely you don’t
believe in that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not? There’s a grain of truth at the bottom
of all old beliefs, and it is as easy to believe
that one’s destiny is controlled by the stars as to
believe in a Divine Providence, sometimes much
easier. The stars are cold, passionless things, inexorable
and fixed, each moving in its appointed
round—passing and repassing other stars, meeting
and parting—alone as human lives are alone. There
are satellites powerless to leave the planet around
which they circle and here and there twin stars that
seem one light from this distance, but doubtless are
really millions of miles separated in space—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught the intent look on her face and smiled:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“No, on the whole I think astrology would not
have been any more satisfactory than astronomy, for
even there, there is nothing clear cut, ‘The stars
incline but do not compel.’ Just one thing is really
sure, one must play with something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here comes Nels,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just in time to keep me from persuading you
that I am quite insane,” said Professor Pendragon.
“I was going to show you a wonderful picture in
the morgue, but it’s too late, Nels, for you’ll never
be able to find it alone, and I am going to buy it.
Some day, if you’ll come and have tea with me—all
of you—you can advise me about the proper place
to hang it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll do that, but I’ll bet I can find it by myself—go
ahead and buy it and when we come to your
house I’ll be able to describe the picture and tell you
who painted it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, if some one tells you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not that; if there’s anything in the morgue
worth your attention, I’ll be sure to notice it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So will I,” said Dorothy. “Come on, Ruth,
let’s look.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth had been wondering whether Pendragon
would go out with them and how she could avoid
his going to the house on Gramercy Square, but evidently
he was as informal as a student, for he only
nodded a careless farewell and strolled off while
they went in search of the picture.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth entered the house with her own key,
which she had taken, not wanting to keep
George waiting up to open the door for her.
The house was quite silent and dark, save for one
dim light burning in the hall, and this light seemed
to illumine a thick blue haze or smoke that floated
out enveloping her as she paused on the threshold.
At the same moment she was conscious of an almost
overpowering odour of incense, something that
Gloria never used, she knew. She stood a moment
peering through the blue haze until she made out a
figure crouching on the stairs, not George as she
at first supposed, but Amy, who seldom showed herself
in the front of the house. She was huddled up,
with clasped arms, weaving to and fro and moaning
inarticulate prayers, while her eyes rolled wildly
about in her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Amy, what’s wrong? Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amy paused in her weaving and moaning to shake
her head negatively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what’s wrong? Is Miss Mayfield ill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the negative shake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’se waitin’ up for yo’, Mis’ Ruth. I want you
to let me sleep upstairs with you all tonight. There’s
a couch in the room what you all paint. I kin use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that,—please, Mis’ Ruth, I’se a dead woman ef you
says no.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What nonsense!” said Ruth, trying to speak
sharply and at the same time in a low tone. Amy,
for all her agitation, kept her voice almost a whisper
and kept turning her head over her shoulder as if
she feared that some one was coming up behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you want to sleep in my studio? Aren’t
you comfortable downstairs? If you’re ill I’ll send
for a doctor. You’ll have to give me some reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She saw that the negro woman’s distress was very
real, however foolish, and laid her hand on her
trembling shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doan ask me no questions now—jes let me
come,” she said rising as if she would accompany
Ruth upstairs against her will, and still looking over
her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t let you come unless you tell me why,”
said Ruth, her voice growing louder in spite of her
efforts to keep it low.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negress laid a warning finger on her lips and
shot a look of such terror over her shoulder that
Ruth felt a sympathetic thrill of horror down her
own spine and peered into the blackness beyond the
stairway, half expecting to see some apparition
there. Then struggling as much to control her own
nerves as those of the servant, she put both hands
on Amy’s shoulders and forced her down on the
stairway again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If there’s any real reason why you should sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>upstairs you can, but you must tell me first what
you’re afraid of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The negress leaned toward her, whispering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s him—that devil-man, George; he a voodoo
and he’s practisin’ black magic down there. I cain’t
sleep in the same paht of the house. I’m goin’ to
give notice in the mawnin’—please, Mis’ Ruth, take
me up with yo’—”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Ruth did not know what to say.
She knew that all negroes are superstitious, but looking
into the rolling eyes of Amy, there in the midnight
silence of the house, she was not able to
laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m surprised at you, Amy. I thought you were
more sensible. What’s George doing? He hasn’t
tried to hurt you, has he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not me, he ain’t goin’ hu’t me—I don’t
expec’ you-all to understand. I don’t care whether
you understands or not, jus’ let me go up with yo’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s George doing?” demanded Ruth again.
She would much rather have given consent at once
and ended the argument, but she could not control
a feeling both of curiosity and nervousness, and was
now protesting more against her own fears than
those of Amy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He tol’ me to go to baid. He orders me roun’
li’e I was his nigger, and I went, but I could see him
through the keyhole—he’s in our settin’-room—it’s
between his room and mine. There’s another do’
to my room and I wen’ right out through it. I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>waste no time. But don’t you-all try to stop him.
He’s at black magic—oh-o-o-o-o-o—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her tense whisper trailed off into a suppressed
wail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with me,” said Ruth with sudden determination.
“I’ll see for myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She started off down the hall, through the thick
blue haze which she could now tell was issuing from
the servants’ quarters, and Amy, protesting, but
evidently fearing to remain behind, walked behind
her. Ruth had never been in the servants’ quarters,
but she knew that they had rooms on the first floor,
which was partly below the street level. As she
passed she switched on the lights in the hall, illuminating
the short flight of steps that led below. The
door at the bottom was closed. At the top of the
steps, Amy caught her arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t go, Mis’ Ruth—jes’ look through the
keyhole once. The do’s locked—don’t knock, jes’
look once—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth shook off her restraining arm, but unconsciously
she softened her footsteps, creeping
almost noiselessly down the steps, while the black
woman waited above. In the silence she could hear
her frightened breathing. She had no intention of
following Amy’s advice, but intended to knock
boldly at the door and then to scold George for
frightening his fellow servant. She was determined
to do that even if George complained to his mistress,
but when her foot touched the last step, something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>stronger than herself restrained her. She stood
a moment with her heart beating against her ribs,
and then, Ruth Mayfield, daughter of respectable
parents, bent down in the attitude of a curious and
untrustworthy servant and applied her eye to the
keyhole. She knelt thus for many minutes before she
finally rose and came back up the steps controlling
by a strong effort of her will the inclination to look
back over her shoulder as she had seen Amy do. At
the top Amy took her arm and together they walked
back through the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the foot of the stairway she turned her white
face to Amy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can come with me if you’ll promise not to
say anything about this to Miss Mayfield, or to leave
for a while at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll promise anything, Mis’ Ruth, only take me
with you—an’ I won’ tell—I ain’ ready to die yit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all just nonsense, Amy, only I don’t want
to worry Gloria with it just now. You understand,
it’s just nonsense,” she repeated with lips that
trembled.</p>

<p class='c007'>She slept fitfully that night, waking in the morning
to the sound of Amy’s knocking at her door. She
called to the servant to come in, eager to talk with
her again before she had an opportunity to speak
to Gloria. She came in with the breakfast tray,
looking much as usual and apparently only too eager
to ignore the events of the night before. She set the
tray down and began rubbing her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“I got a misery,” she whined, “the wu’k in this
house is too ha’ad. They’se wu’uk enough here for
foah and only two to do it all. I’se neber wu’uked
in a big house like this befo’ less they was at least
foah kep’. I’se a cook, I is, not a maid, and what
not. Nex’ thing she’ll be askin’ me to do laundry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Amy, that isn’t fair. The house is big,
but Miss Mayfield only uses about half of it, and you
know she dines out almost more than in. Besides I
don’t want you to go away yet. If you’ll stay I’ll
ask Miss Mayfield to let you sleep up here all the
time. I can tell her that I’m nervous up here so
far away from every one and I’m sure she won’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amy’s face beamed with pleasure. “Is you-all
goin’ speak to her ’bout Go’ge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at once—I must have time to think about
that, and you must be quiet, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’ you fret; I ain’ goin’ say anything ef
you-all doan’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the door she turned again and looked at Ruth
as if she would like to ask a question, but Ruth
pretended not to see, and she went out without
speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>What Ruth had seen could not be ignored, yet
she could not go to Gloria and tell her that she had
deliberately peeked through keyholes, especially as
there was no way of proving that she had seen what
she had seen. George did not practise his rites every
night or Amy would have long since fled in terror.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The only thing to do was to try and persuade Gloria
to discharge George for some other cause, or failing
that, to watch an opportunity to show Gloria what
she had seen. But perhaps Gloria already knew.
That did not seem exactly probable, but Gloria was
a strange woman and she said that George had been
in her service a long time—before her marriage to
Professor Pendragon. Perhaps Professor Pendragon—</p>

<p class='c007'>Her thoughts lost themselves in trying to unravel
the tangled skein of Professor Pendragon, Gloria
and her marriages, George and his evident connection
with everything. She remembered George’s
warning whisper of the night before. Pendragon
might be able to explain everything to her, but she
could not ask him about George without also giving
him information of Gloria, a thing she had promised
not to do. The night before she had thought that
she might go direct to Gloria with her story about
George, but in the light of morning it sounded both
fantastic and unreal—as foolish as the fears of the
superstitious Amy had seemed before she, herself,
had investigated her wild story.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would be late to class this morning, for she
had waked late and had dressed slowly with her
thoughts. On her way downstairs she passed
Gloria’s room. The door was open and Gloria was
sitting up in bed surrounded by innumerable papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you in a hurry?” she called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not much,” which was true, for being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>already late, Ruth was wondering whether it would
be worth while to try and attend her first class.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you can help me out—can’t make anything
of all this,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bills and my bank account—they don’t seem to
match somehow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She thrust a mass of papers toward Ruth, who sat
down on the side of the bed and began to look at
them. She picked up an assortment of bills, some
of them months old, some of them just arrived, some
of them mere statements of indebtedness, others with
pertinent phrases attached thereto, such as “An immediate
settlement will be appreciated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth found a pencil and a pad and began to add
up the various amounts—they totalled several
thousand dollars. The idea of so much indebtedness
frightened Ruth. All her life she had been accustomed
to paying for things when she got them.
Since coming to New York she had discovered that
this was bourgeoise and inartistic, but training and
heredity were stronger than environment with her
and she still had a horror of debt. However, she
tried to conceal her surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, if you’ll let me see your check book and
your pass book, perhaps we can discover why they
don’t match,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here they are—go as far as you like. I never
could make anything of figures, except debts,” said
Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“But you haven’t made out more than half the
stubs on your checks—how can I tell what you’ve
spent unless you’ve kept some record of it?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—they balance the book now and
then at the bank, but I don’t know as it’s much use.
The truth is I really can’t afford to keep up this
house, even with only two servants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you rent it and then get an apartment
and let George go and keep Amy? You could do
with one servant in a small apartment and I could
pay half the expense—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You could not! I thought I made that quite
clear. I can’t have any one living with me except as
a guest—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know why, except that it flatters my
vanity. Besides I can’t give up the house. I’ve got
to keep it whether I can afford it or not. Where
would Billie and any number of other people live
when they’re out of work if they didn’t have this
big house to come to? I got a note from Ben Stark
yesterday. His company broke up in Saint Louis
last week and he’s coming on here. I wrote that I
could put him up until he gets another engagement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Gloria, don’t you see that you can’t afford
to do that sort of thing? You’re too generous. No
one likes to talk about money, but one must talk
about money—it’s always coming in at the most
inopportune moments and unless we recognize it
politely at first it’s sure to show up at the worst time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>possible later. You can’t afford to be always giving
and never taking anything from any one. If you’d
only let me live here on a sensible basis—it would
make me feel much more comfortable, and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would not,” said Gloria. “If I’d known you
were going to be sensible and practical and all that
sort of thing, I wouldn’t have asked you to look at
the silly, old bills. And I’m not generous at all.
I’m selfish. Generous people are the sort of people
who accept favors gracefully—people like Billie
Irwin and Ben Stark. Besides we aren’t sure yet.
I may have money enough to pay all this—only it’s
such a bore writing checks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She smiled cheerfully at the thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll tell you what—I’ll take your book to the
bank and have it balanced and then we can find out
just what is wrong, and I’ll take care of it all for
you. I did all that sort of thing for Mother, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a dear, and just to show you that I can
help myself too I’m going to do something that I
suppose I should have done long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of Gloria’s pet extravagances was having
telephone extensions in all the rooms that she herself
used. She reached out now to the telephone by
her bed and called a number.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Mr. Davis there?” she asked. “Tell him
Miss Mayfield wants to talk to him.” Then after
a pause: “Good morning—you remember you
offered me a contract last week. Is it still open?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Send it over and I’ll sign it— Tomorrow? Yes, I
can begin tomorrow. Nine o’clock—that’s awfully
early, but I can do it I suppose if other people do.
Yes, thanks. Woman’s prerogative and I have
changed mine. Tomorrow, then— Thank you— Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There now, I’ve promised to go to work in the
movies and earn some money. Meantime if you can
straighten out my financial puzzle I shall be most
grateful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever worked in motion pictures before?”
asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but we all come to it sooner or later, that
is if they’ll take us. I haven’t any illusions about it.
They may not like me at all. Being an actress on the
speaking stage doesn’t always mean that one can
make a picture actress. Half the down and out
artists of the spoken drama who scorn the movies,
couldn’t get in if they tried. But if they give me a
contract for a few weeks I’ll have that at least, and
then if I’m no good I won’t have to worry about it
any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has Miss Irwin an engagement yet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but she’s doing her best, poor dear. It’s
awfully hard in the middle of the season. Angela
Peyton-Russell is going to give a Christmas party at
their house in the Berkshires. I’ll have her invite
you, too. If I work a few weeks in pictures I’ll be
ready for a rest. By the way, did you see Percy
last night?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Suddenly Ruth had a suspicion that this was the
real reason why she had been called in. Gloria’s
tone was almost too casual and she had asked her
question without introduction, abruptly in the middle
of other things.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I met him and he’s awfully nice and good
looking, but I told him that I had no relatives and
that I am living with friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He asked then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I suppose the name made him curious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He isn’t married?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he is his wife was not with him and he
didn’t mention her. I’m almost sure that he’s
not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he talk about astronomy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—that is yes—only to say that he’d given it
up and art is his latest fad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take care you don’t fall in love with him, he’s
very fascinating,” said Gloria, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know—why did you divorce him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How should I know?” Gloria frowned impatiently.
“Oh, because he was quite impossible—as
a husband. All men are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll take your book to the bank now. I’ve
missed my morning class anyway,” said Ruth rising.
The weight of all the things she knew and guessed,
and did not know, was pressing heavily on her and
she longed for some one to whom she could tell
everything and get advice. Obviously her temperamental
aunt was not the one.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>At the door she paused again, making one last
effort to simplify her problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you discharge George anyway and
get another woman? I’m sure he must be very expensive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t like George, do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t. He’s not like any nigger I ever
saw before. Where did he come from anyway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know exactly. He is a Hindoo, half-caste
I imagine, or he wouldn’t work as a servant,
and I found him in London. It was just before I
married Percy. George had been working in one
of the music halls as a magician and he was ill. I
took care of him. His colour didn’t matter—he was
in The Profession, in a way, you know, and when
he got well he offered to work for me and he’s been
with me ever since, about eleven years. I really
couldn’t do without George, you know. Percy didn’t
like him either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why doesn’t he go back into vaudeville? He
could make more money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gratitude, I suppose—anyway, that wouldn’t
make very much difference, and so long as I have any
money at all, I shall keep George.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know that he is really a Hindoo?”
asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me that when I first found him. You’re
more curious about George than Percy was. Percy
always said he looked like something come to life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>from a pyramid, but George never liked Percy and
he won’t like you if you ask him questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shan’t ask him questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do wish you hadn’t met Percy—he keeps coming
into my mind. Did he look well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well indeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Happy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s more difficult—you know I’d never seen
him before, so it would be hard to tell. If you—why
didn’t you let me tell him the truth; then probably
you’d have seen for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I wouldn’t. He might have thought that I
deliberately tried to see him. Anyway I don’t want
to see him. I was only curious. Don’t speak about
him again, even if I ask. I want to forget him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth went out with thoughts more conflicting than
before. One moment she thought she detected in
Gloria a sentimental interest in her former husband;
the next she appeared to hate him, and apparently
there was no hope of persuading her to send
George away. She went to the restaurant on Eighth
Avenue for lunch, where she met Nels and Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think?” said Nels. “I just heard
that Professor Pendragon is ill—paralysis or something
like that, and he certainly looked well last
night. I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The news doesn’t seem to have affected your appetite
any,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not—must keep up steam. Shouldn’t
wonder if that was why he’s ill. He never eats anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>much. One can’t paint greatly unless one eats
greatly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did he get ill, and how?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he went home from the show last night—It’s
extraordinary because he’s never been troubled
that way and he was quite well just a short time before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth was thinking of George and of all the old
tales she had ever heard of the evil eye and black
magic. She was thinking of these things with one
part of her brain, while with another part she scoffed
at herself for being a superstitious, silly fool. If
only Amy hadn’t persuaded her to look through the
keyhole.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to go and see him tomorrow afternoon,”
said Nels. “I’d go today, but I have to
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take us with you,” said Dorothy. “He invited
us to tea anyway and he seemed to be interested in
Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One can’t go to tea with a paralytic, Dot, besides,
he lives in a hotel, unless they’ve moved him
to a hospital. I’ll find out and if it’s all right of
course you can go too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just look at Ruth, Nels; she looks as concerned
as if the dragon were a dear friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not at all; it’s just that it’s sudden—and I
was thinking of something else too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was remembering Gloria’s last words about
not mentioning Pendragon’s name again. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>was another piece of information that she must keep
to herself. It was so annoying to be just one person
with only one pair of eyes and ears and only one
small brain. If she could only see inside and know
what Gloria was really thinking, what depths of
ignorance or wickedness were concealed behind
George’s black brows, what secret Professor Pendragon
knew—and even, yes, it might blight
romance, but she would like to know just what Terry
Riordan thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did Gloria love Terry or did her heart still belong
to her first husband? And what of those other
two whose names were never mentioned? If only
she could be one of those wonderful detective girls
one read about in magazine stories. How simply
she would solve everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found Terry with Gloria when she reached
home. They were talking interestedly as they always
did, with eyes for no one else apparently, and
her heart sank. George came in to ask come question
about dinner. He did look like something that
had stepped from the carvings on a pyramid. His
fine features were inexpressibly cruel, yet there was
something splendid about him too. He was so tall—taller
than Gloria. Tall enough to play—she
stopped affrighted at her unnatural thought.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The entire régime of the house on Gramercy
Square had been changed. Instead of rising
at eleven o’clock Gloria now left the house
shortly after eight, to be at the motion picture
studios in New Jersey at nine, so that Ruth seldom
saw her before dinner time. The balancing of
Gloria’s bank book disclosed that she had been living
at a rate far in excess of her income—news that did
not seem to trouble Gloria at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll make it all up again in a few weeks now that
I’m working,” she said. “If you’ll only write out
a book full of checks for my poor, dear creditors,
I’ll sign them and then you can mail them out and
everything will be lovely—for a few months at
least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but don’t you think you ought to regulate
your expenditures according to your assured income,
Gloria? You know you aren’t always working,”
said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t be troubled with that now. Wait until
I get tangled up again—something always happens,
and nothing could be worse than the pictures;
regular hours like a shopgirl, and no audience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth returned from school to find Gloria not yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>home and the drawing-room empty, except perhaps
for Billie Irwin and Ben Stark, a tall, good-natured
youth, who had followed hard upon his letter and
who was perpetually asking Ruth to go to theatres
with him, where he had “professional courtesy”
due to having worked on Broadway the season before.
If Ruth refused, as she sometimes did, he
cheerfully turned his invitation to Billie Irwin, seemingly
as pleased with her society as with that of the
younger woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>It troubled Ruth to think of them all, herself and
Miss Irwin and Ben Stark, all living here as if Gloria
had unlimited wealth, while Gloria went out every
morning to uncongenial work to keep up with the
expenses of her too large ménage. Only that morning
Amy had complained to her of having so many
breakfasts to prepare for people who rose whenever
they pleased and never remembered to make
her any presents. If only George would grow dissatisfied—but
he never seemed weary of serving
Gloria’s impecunious guests, and if he was still engaged
in midnight orgies of enchantment Ruth could
not know. She dared not repeat the keyhole experiment.
She wished that she had not taken Amy
upstairs to sleep; then she would have had a spy
below stairs. It was foolish of her to connect
Professor Pendragon’s illness with George, but she
could not help it. If she could only have some other
opinion to go by—or perhaps when she had seen
Professor Pendragon again, her illusion would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>dispelled. Nels Zord had talked with him over the
telephone and Professor Pendragon had made light
of his illness and said he would be glad to have Nels
and the two girls come and have tea with him the
following Thursday. He said he was not going to
a hospital and hoped to be quite well when they
came. If he was well then Ruth could laugh at
her superstitious fears. Thursday was a good day
for all of them because there was no lecture Thursday
afternoon and they could all leave the Art
Students’ League at half-past four and go together
to Professor Pendragon’s hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of visiting a man in his hotel, even a
man of forty who was ill, and in company with two
other people did not seem quite proper to Ruth,
but she did not say anything about it, having acquired
the habit of taking customs and conventions
as she found them. Nevertheless she was quite relieved
to find that Professor Pendragon had a suite
and that they were ushered into a pleasant room with
no hint either of sickness or sleep in it. She even
took time to wonder where the prejudice against
sleeping rooms as places of ordinary social intercourse
first originated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Pendragon met them, leaning on a
crutch, one foot lifted in the attitude of a delightful,
old stork.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s really kind of you to come,” he said, after
he had made them all comfortable. “You know I
have hundreds of acquaintances but very few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>friends, as I have discovered since I became a victim
of the evil eye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth could not restrain a start of surprise and
he looked at her, his dark eyes wrinkling with
mirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you know about the evil eye?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t. Only I suppose the phrase startled
me. What really is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know and neither do the doctors apparently;
that’s why I call it the evil eye. I came home
from the show that night and went to sleep like a
good Christian with a quiet conscience, but when
I woke I found that my right leg was paralysed to
the knee. It was the dark of the moon that night.
I know because I always think in more or less
almanacal terms—that would be when the evil eye
would be most effective, you know; and I’m waiting
for the full moon to see if I will not be cured as
mysteriously as I have been afflicted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nels and Dorothy were listening with puzzled
eyes, not quite knowing whether Professor Pendragon
was jesting or in earnest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean all maniacal terms, if you believe
such rubbish,” said Nels, “and you need a brain
specialist, not a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that’s our tea at the door, if you’ll please
open it for me, Nels, and I promise not to talk about
the evil eye in the presence of such moderns as you
and Miss Winslow again.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Why don’t you include Ruth in that?” asked
Dorothy, as Nels rose to open the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Miss Mayfield is not a modern at all;
she belongs to the dark middle ages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I’m a bit superstitious,” admitted
Ruth, and then hoping to test his sincerity, for he
had spoken throughout with a smile, and also to
throw, if possible, some light on the uncanny suspicions
that troubled her—“Even if you did believe
in the evil eye, who would want to harm
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please do stop,” said Dorothy. “You’re spoiling
my tea with your gruesome talk. Where’s the
picture that Nels was to point out and advise you
about hanging?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is, perhaps, a more wholesome topic, but
we were only joking, Miss Mayfield and I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve found the picture already,” exclaimed Nels—“the
one with the fat Bacchus—you see I picked
it out of all the others—I don’t blame you for
buying it; it’s delightful humour, depicting Bacchus
as a modern business man, fat and bald, yet clad in
a leopard skin with grape vines on his head, and
tearing through the forest with a slim, young nymph
in his arms—it’s grotesque and fascinating.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you’d approve,” said Professor Pendragon.
“Now where shall we hang it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right where it is, unless you have a larger
picture to hang there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, while you’re unable to walk around, why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>don’t you sit for a portrait—you’ll never have another
time when the sittings will be less irksome.
I’d come here and Ruth could come with me as a
chaperon, not that I need one, but we might as well
be perfectly proper when it’s just as pleasant—you
know,” she continued, slightly embarrassed by the
smiles on the faces of Nels, Professor Pendragon,
and Ruth. “I’m not looking for a commission at
all; I just want to paint you because you will make
an interesting subject, and because, if I can hang
you—I mean get your picture hung in the Academy,
I will get real commissions, just because you sat
for me. Now I’ve been perfectly frank,” she
finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pendragon held out his hand to her, laughing:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any of those numerous reasons ought to be
enough,” he said, “and if my infirmity lasts long
enough, I’ll be glad to have you come and help me
kill time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better start before next dark of the moon,”
said Ruth mischievously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That gives you only ten more days,” said Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t really believe in those things?”—Dorothy’s
blue eyes were wide with distress—“Please
tell me the truth; Nels, they’re just teasing,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, you know they are; don’t be a silly
goose, Dot,” said Nels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know they are, but even if they don’t believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in all they say, they believe in something that I don’t
understand, now, don’t you?—confess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned to Ruth, but it was Pendragon who
answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If mind is stronger than matter, and most of
us believe that now, then an evil thought has power
over matter just as surely as a good thought has
power, and the power of the evil thought will continue
until it is dispelled by good thought. There
if you like is black and white magic. I believe that
there are people in the world so crushed by fear and
wickedness that every breath of their bodies and
every glance of their eyes is a blight on all who
come near them, and I believe that there are people
who are so fearless and good that where they walk,
health and happiness spreads round them as an
aura, as sunlight on every life that touches them.
Does that satisfy you, Miss Dorothy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes, that’s very beautiful, I’m sure,” said
Dorothy, looking a bit uncomfortable as if she had
been listening to a sermon. “When will you let
me come for your first sitting?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sunday morning if you like; that won’t interfere
with your classes, and it’s a good day for me
too, because I am duller than usual on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As they were leaving, Ruth lingered for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you did have an enemy who was trying to
harm you, what would you do, Professor Pendragon?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Evil works like good, can only be accomplished
with faith; if I had an enemy, I would destroy his
faith in his own power,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth found the entire family, as Gloria called her
household, assembled when she reached the house
on Gramercy Park. Terry Riordan was among
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, Ruth, won’t you go to the theatre with
Terry tonight? He has a perfect passion for first
nights, but as an honest working woman I need my
rest and I’m too tired to go tonight,” said Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to, but—” Ruth glanced in the direction
of Ben Stark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t mind me,” said that youth. “The
fact that you have refused me three times won’t
make any difference. I’m accustomed to such treatment
from the fair sex.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you come with us?” said Terry.
“I have three tickets and intended taking both
Gloria and Ruth if they would go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, Miss Ruth, will you let me go with
you? I’ll walk a few paces in the rear and be a good
little boy,” said Ben. “You really must be kind to
me, because I’m going into rehearsals for another
trip to the coast with a company that will probably
go at least as far as Buffalo. You’ll miss my cheery
smile when I am far away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we’ll all go together,” agreed Ruth, rather
annoyed that Terry should have suggested that Ben
go with them. Evidently he considered her too young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to be an interesting companion and would be glad
to have another man to talk to. It was perhaps for
this reason that when they started out she directed
most of her smiles and conversation to the erstwhile
neglected Ben, making that young man beam with
pleasure, while Terry seemed not to observe his
neglected state at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s wrong, old chap? You are as solemn
as an owl and you ought to be as happy as larks
are supposed to be, with a real, honest-to-goodness
show on Broadway,” said Ben.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s going off next week,” said Terry. “It’s
been nothing but a paper house for a week, and
they’re going to try it on the road; I don’t seem to
have the trick or the recipe for success.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m so sorry; perhaps it will go well on the
road,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t feel sorry; it doesn’t matter very much;
I’ll write another. A man must do something and
if I grow very successful I might be tempted to
stop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, one must play some game; that’s what Professor
Pendragon says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, you met Gloria’s husband, didn’t
you? What’s he like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very nice; I’ll tell you later all about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were entering the theatre now and Ruth
wanted to talk to Terry about Professor Pendragon
when no one else was listening. Ben Stark was a
jarring note that precluded absolute revealment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>her hopes and fears. Nevertheless she forgot to
be annoyed at his presence in the theatre for he
amused her with his comments about people on and
off the stage and Terry was strangely silent. The
play was a particularly inane bit of fluff and seemed
to be making a great hit. Ruth could imagine the
trend of his thoughts, the discouragement attendant
upon doing his best and seeing it fail, and watching
the success of an inferior endeavour, yet she envied
him, for he at least believed in his own work, and
the more she studied and compared her work with
that of other students, the more a creeping doubt
of her own ability filled her brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I need cheering up! Won’t you go to supper
with me?” he asked as they passed out of the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>His invitation was addressed to both Ben and
Ruth, but Ben, with motives which Ruth understood
only too well begged off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I have to report for rehearsals
tomorrow morning, if you don’t mind I’ll run
along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He evidently thought that Terry would like to
be alone with Ruth, and Ruth, realizing his mistake,
was yet too timid to protest, even had she not secretly
desired to be alone with Terry. She had
never gone to supper with a man alone. It would
be an adventure, and the fact that she loved the
man even though he did not know or care, made it
even more thrilling. She bethought herself of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>costume and wished that she were in evening
clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’d better take you some place near
home,” said Terry. “If we use a cab we can save
time, and there won’t be so many people downtown
and we’ll be served quicker. I feel a bit guilty
about keeping you out late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not a child,” said Ruth, pouting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you’re not, but you are—you’ll always
be one, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was about to ask why, but they were entering
a cab now and she did not ask. She wanted to
ask where they were going, but she did not ask that
either. She found herself with Terry afflicted with
a strange inability to talk. They rode almost in
silence to Fourteenth Street and entered a most
disappointing place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth’s idea of supper after the theatre was a
place of soft lights and music with beautifully
dressed women and flowers, and sparkling wine.
She didn’t want to drink the sparkling wine herself
or even to wear the beautiful gowns, but she wanted
to see them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The place they entered was a low ceiled, dark
paneled room with no music visible or audible.
There were white spread tables, but the women
around them were far from beautiful, the men undistinguished
in the extreme—matrons on the heavy
order with men who were quite obviously, even to
Ruth’s untrained gaze, their lawful spouses. Both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>men and women were giving more attention to their
food, than to their companions and they were drinking—beer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s quiet here and we can talk,” said Terry,
quite oblivious to Ruth’s disappointment, but when
they were seated he did not talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me about the new comedy you’re writing,”
said Ruth, remembering the axiom that it is always
tactful to talk to a man about his own work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I want to forget my work and myself.
Let’s gossip. Tell me about Gloria’s husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this Ruth thought she detected the interest of
a jealous suitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Pendragon is very charming and
very clever and good looking. He is taller than
Gloria, and apparently has no particular vocation,
for he has given up astronomy. His interest in art
he calls a fad; he lives alone in a suite in the
Belton Hotel and about ten days ago he became
mysteriously paralysed—his right leg up to the
knee. That’s all I know,” said Ruth, “except that
he’s one of the most fascinating men I’ve ever seen
and I can’t understand why any woman would ever
give him up. He’s almost as wonderful as Gloria
herself. I’d like to say that he is ugly and old and
disagreeable for your sake, but he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry looked at her uncomprehendingly for a
moment and then ignored her inference if he understood
it at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a lot of information to have collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>all about one person,” he said. “They say it was
a great love match and that they disagreed over
some trifle. They met and were married in London
and Gloria got a divorce in Paris less than a
year later. Curious his turning up just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why just now?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Gloria is a woman who must at all
times have some absorbing interest, and recently she
hasn’t had one and it’s telling on her. She has fits
of moodiness, and wild ideas that she never carries
out—like the proposed sudden trip to Palm Beach.
Two years ago when I first met Gloria she would
have gone. If only I could finish my comedy and
make it a real success with Gloria in the star
rôle—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would really like to do things for Gloria,”
said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I’m awfully fond of her. She’s been my
friend and has helped me ever since I first met her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, please, can’t you persuade her to get rid
of George?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an intense appeal in Ruth’s voice that
surprised Terry more than her request.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why? How would that help her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t explain it exactly. There are several
reasons. One is that Gloria has been living quite
beyond her income—I suppose I shouldn’t tell these
things even to you, but I am worried about her and
perhaps you can help—and she simply refuses to
give up her big house because it serves as a refuge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>for professional people, friends of hers, out of an
engagement. Of course all these people think that
Gloria has unlimited means or they wouldn’t come.
She won’t even let me help her, though I could quite
easily. It’s because she really needs money that
she’s gone to work in motion pictures. I imagine
that George is an expensive servant and I thought
if we could make her discharge him, she could get
some one else for less money. Of course that
wouldn’t make much difference in her expenses—I
understand that—but it would be a start. It’s a
lot of small economies that count, you know,” she
said gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had no idea that Gloria didn’t have lots of
money. Her second husband was Darral Knight,
a man who had made a fortune in toilet preparations.
It was he who gave her the house on
Gramercy Square. Then she married Brooks
Grosvenor and he settled an income on her when
they were divorced. I always supposed that it was
ample. Certainly from what I’ve heard of the man
he would have it fixed so that she could not get anything
but the income, and even that would be forfeited
if she married again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The income isn’t large, not really large enough
to afford such a big house, and Gloria has gone in
debt a lot and now she’s working to pay it off. You
see she’d have enough money if she would consent
to live differently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Gloria is not the sort of person who will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>ever live differently. I have often wondered how
she got by in such a big house with perpetual guests
and only two servants, but I suppose she just didn’t
want to bother with any more. But that isn’t the
reason you want her to get rid of George, is it? It
really wouldn’t make any appreciable difference,
would it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—there are other reasons too, but I’m afraid
to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something you don’t like to put into words?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I know. I’ve thought of it myself and
I don’t like to put it into words either, but I will,
so that we can understand each other perfectly—a
necessary thing if we are to help Gloria.” He
paused looking at her, and seemingly trying to
gather courage for what he was about to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think that George is in love with his mistress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth’s horrified face revealed that Terry had put
into words something quite foreign to anything in
her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t look so horrified, it sounds terrible to
us—it is terrible, but you must remember that
George is a Hindoo, not a nigger, and that he is
well educated, and that in many parts of the world,
the idea of a black man loving a white woman is
not so repugnant as it is here. I wouldn’t admit it
for a long time myself, but it’s the only plausible
explanation of a lot of things. Perhaps Gloria has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>told you that when she first met George he was a
magician mahatma, who had been playing in
London music halls and that he had been out of
work for some time on account of illness. Out of
gratitude, apparently, he offered to serve her. Later
when he had quite recovered his health he could
easily have gone back to his former work, but he
didn’t go, though regardless of what Gloria pays
him, it must be much less than he could make on the
stage. If you’ve observed too, you will have seen
that his attitude, while quite respectful, is never the
attitude of a servant, and toward Gloria’s men
friends his attitude is almost offensively disrespectful,
especially when she is not present. He even
hates me. I’ve thought for a long time that she
ought to get rid of him, but I can’t go to her and
tell her what I think, for certainly Gloria doesn’t suspect
anything like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During this explanation, Ruth, recovered from
the first shock of his words, was thinking rapidly.
All her fears and superstitions came back one hundred
fold in the light of Terry’s revelation. They
gave reason and purpose to what she had seen and
what she had suspected. She debated in her mind
whether she dare tell everything to Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But evidently you had something else in mind—some
other reason,” he continued. “What was
it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at his grey blue eyes and brown hair,
his clear, fair skin and firm chin—he was Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of the West—he would never understand or believe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing,” she answered. “I suppose it’s just
that I sensed what you have said, without ever daring
to put it into words even in my own thoughts.
Couldn’t you try and tempt George back on to the
stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—I couldn’t, because he doesn’t
like me, but I might get some one else to do it, that
is if he hasn’t forgotten all his old tricks. Eleven
years is a long time, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he hasn’t—” but she decided not to finish
her sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The restaurant was almost deserted now, and
Terry bethought himself, with many apologies, of
his resolve not to keep Ruth out too late. He
would have hurried into another cab, but Ruth protested
that it was such a short distance and she
wanted to walk. In reality she thought that in the
darkness when she could not see his face so clearly
she might find the courage to tell him. Yet she
walked silent by his side, unable to speak. She was
lost in the wonder of being alone with him—he was
so tall and wonderful. She looked up at the stars
and gratitude filled her heart. It was good to love,
even when love was unreciprocated. She pitied
women who had never loved, as she did, unselfishly—a
love more like adoration than earthly passion.
She wanted to help Terry and Gloria. She would
rejoice in their marriage. If she could only solve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>their problems, she would not care what life held for
her after that. It was an exalted mood for a girl
of nineteen years, some months and days, and
Terry, all unsuspecting, broke into it with words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish we could arrange to have Gloria and
Professor Pendragon meet again,” he said. “Pendragon
was the big love of her life, and no man
ever having once loved Gloria could possibly be
quite free of her sway. She made the other marriages
just for excitement, I think. I can’t imagine
any other reason. I’d like to have them meet again.
It would be interesting to say the least. I’m horribly
unmodern, but I believe that men and women
love once and once only.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to Ruth that there was a note of sad
resignation and generous resolve in his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’ve promised Gloria that I will not let
him know anything about her. It’s very generous
of you to want to—to bring them together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Terry did not speak. He seemed
to be considering her words and looked at her in a
curious way that she did not understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not generosity—perhaps only curiosity,” he
said. “Gloria and I have been such good friends—and
I am tremendously fond of her. She is so
beautiful and charming and talented, but just now
I think she needs something, some one, bigger than
her work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had reached home, Ruth in a state of exalted
pain and happiness. Terry loved Gloria; that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>evident, but for some reason he did not hope to
win her. With noble generosity he was hoping
only for Gloria’s happiness—planning to bring her
and Professor Pendragon together. Somehow it
seemed that she and Terry were sharing sacrifice—he
his love for Gloria, she her love for him. It
gave her a feeling of sweet comradeship with him,
that almost compensated for the pain of knowing
that he did not love her. Perhaps behind her
thoughts too there was the faint hope that if
Gloria went back to her first husband, Terry might
change the object of his affections, but this thought
was only half defined, for at nineteen the idea of a
man loving twice is very inartistic. To Ruth all
real love was of the <i>Abelard and Heloise, Paul and
Virginia</i> type.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus she thought in silence while Terry waited
for her to unlock the door. The door opened to
her key and she turned to say good-night to him,
when her nostrils caught the overpowering perfume
of some strange incense, and in the hall she saw the
same blue haze that she had seen that night when
she found Amy on the stairs. Terry, too, had smelled
the incense, and paused, looking at her for explanation.
Her heart was beating at a tremendous rate.
Here was the opportunity that she had been seeking
to secure an unbiased witness. She put her finger
to her lips in sign of silence, as Amy had done that
night, and drew him with her into the hall. Then
she closed the door silently behind them. Without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>knowing why he imitated her example in silence.
Inside the hall was heavy with the blue smoke and
the perfume that seemed to be smothering them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I can show you why I want Gloria to send
George away. He’s downstairs now, I think,” she
was speaking in a low whisper. “I want you to see
for yourself. I haven’t dared to tell any one for
fear they wouldn’t believe. He’s down there,” she
pointed. “Don’t knock or let him know you’re
coming—I want you to see everything. Perhaps—I
know it sounds a terrible thing to do, but if you could
just look through the keyhole—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped abruptly, seeing Terry’s look of
amazement at such a request.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Believe me—it is better to do that—just look
once and you’ll understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She moved toward the rear of the house, tiptoeing
noiselessly and beckoning him to follow. At the
top of the short flight of steps she stopped again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down there, behind that door,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>As one preparing to dispel the foolish fears of a
nervous woman, Terry advanced down the steps,
yet such was the influence of the hour, the strange
incense and Ruth’s manner that he walked softly.
Ruth followed him, but at the bottom Terry did not
bend down to look through the keyhole. Before
Ruth’s frightened eyes he put his hand to the handle
of the door, which swung inward at his touch.</p>

<p class='c007'>A deeper blue haze than that above filled the room
into which they looked. In the centre of the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>George was kneeling—about his head a white turban
was wound and he was wrapped in a long, black
robe on which the signs of the zodiac were picked
out in gold thread. Before him was placed an altar,
which rose in a series of seven steps. At the bottom
a lamp was burning with a blue flame, from which
the clouds of incense were rising, almost obscuring
what lay coiled on the topmost step which spread
into a flat platform—an enormous serpent coiled,
with its head lifted from the centre of the mass and
swaying from side to side, seemingly in accompaniment
to a low monotonous chant that George was
singing, while he too swayed back and forth, for
some moments seeming not to know that the door
had been opened. Ruth could not understand the
words of the chant, but from the tone they sounded
like an invocation. George was praying to his reptile!
Suddenly, as if he had just seen them, he lifted
his hands and his voice rose, and the snake reared its
head far into the air, so that they could see its darting,
forked tongue. Then as George’s voice suddenly
stopped on a high note the snake subsided
again, and George rose to his feet and greeted
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening,” he said, “I was just practising
my box of tricks. You know I used to be a professional
magician and Miss Mayfield has asked me to
accompany her to the Christmas party in the country
to help entertain the guests of the Peyton-Russells.
The snake is quite harmless,” he continued, picking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>it up on both hands and dropping it over his shoulders.
“Would you like to touch it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, no,” said Ruth, drawing back and instinctively
clutching Terry’s arm. Terry did not accept
the invitation either, but to Ruth’s surprise he
seemed to accept George’s explanation of the strange
scene as truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were attracted by the smell of the incense,”
he explained, “thought it might be fire and we’d
better investigate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, quite right.” Never had George’s
voice sounded so silky and lisping and sinister. He
stood quite still, seemingly waiting for them to go,
the snake coiled round his shoulders. Ruth was
only too glad to make her escape and Terry followed
her. In the hall he turned to her smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No wonder you were frightened if that’s what
you saw, but you see it’s quite all right—Gloria
knows about it and it hasn’t any significance. Of
course snakes aren’t pleasant things to have in the
house, but this one is harmless, so I hope it won’t
disturb your sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you believe what George said,” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I don’t. He may be practising tricks
for the Christmas party—that may be true, but there
was no trick to what we saw just now—the snake
was real, and the altar and the incense—and George
was praying—he was praying to that snake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so,” said Terry. “We’re not missionaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>that we should try to convert the heathen. I don’t
care how many snake worshippers there are in New
York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t that, Terry—I know it sounds weird, but
the night I saw him before, was the night Professor
Pendragon was stricken with paralysis—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped frightened by the lack of comprehension
in Terry’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you see if George will worship a snake,
he is the sort of person who will pray calamities on
his enemies. If he loves Gloria, then he hates
Professor Pendragon, because he is the only man
Gloria has loved. When Pendragon’s name was
first mentioned, you remember the Sunday morning
I got the card to the water colour show, George
was even more concerned than Gloria, and when I
went he warned me to be careful what I said. I
believe that he is responsible for Pendragon’s
illness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Comprehension had dawned in Terry’s face, but
with it Ruth could see a tolerant incredulity and a
wonder that she could believe such nonsense.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s reasonable enough that George hates Pendragon,
but even if he does hate him and even if
he was actually praying for him to be harmed, that
doesn’t give a prop snake the power to carry out his
wishes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t the snake; it’s the power of George’s
concentrated thought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thoughts can’t harm people,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“But they can—thoughts are things and evil
thoughts are as powerful as good ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She could almost see the thoughts passing through
Terry’s brain. He was looking at her, assuring
himself that she really was sane and had been up to
this night quite normal, almost uninterestingly
normal, and even while she tried to make her beliefs
clear she was conscious of a feeling of exultation
because for the first time she was actually interesting
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve heard of Indian fakirs who could paralyse
parts of their own bodies so that knives could be
thrust into them without causing the slightest pain,
but I never heard of one who exercised such power
over another person, but even if that were possible
how would it help to send George away? If Gloria
sent him away, he could still keep on thinking and
worshipping snakes, too, for that matter,” he said,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Pendragon told me that if he had an
enemy who was trying to harm him, he would try
and destroy that enemy’s faith in his ability to harm.
What we must do is destroy the snake first. George
worships the snake or some power of which the
snake is a symbol. Either way if we destroy the
snake we destroy George’s confidence in his ability
to harm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t any objections to killing snakes. In
my opinion that’s what the horrid beasts were
created for, but this particular snake is probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>very valuable—he belongs to the profession and
everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please don’t jest about it, Terry; it may be a
matter of life and death. If I hear that Professor
Pendragon is worse instead of better tomorrow, I
will be sure. Then we must do something before it
is too late. You must promise to help me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She laid her hand on his arm and looked up at
him with such genuine fear and entreaty in her eyes
that for a moment he understood and sympathized
with all of her beliefs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I’ll help,” he promised, “but now I’d
best go, and you must go to bed and try not to dream
of snakes.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth waited impatiently for the noon hour,
so that she might ask Nels what news he
had of Professor Pendragon, but when she
finally met him he had not seen nor heard from
the Professor since the day they all had tea together.
On Sunday morning Dorothy was to go to him to
begin his portrait and Ruth was to accompany her.
Until then she probably would get no news. In the
afternoon when she returned to the house she found
Gloria there before her, having returned early from
the motion picture studios. Terry was there too,
reading the last of his new comedy which was now
completed. Gloria was enthusiastic about it and
Billie Irwin, who had been quite depressed for over
a fortnight, was now as cheery as if the contract
was already signed, for Gloria had picked out a part
that must certainly be given to Billie if she, herself,
was to play the lead.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all talked as if the production of the play
was assured, and as if no one but the author would
have a word to say about how it should be cast, a
thing that seemed quite logical to Ruth until Terry
himself explained that he would have very little to
say about it, except as to Gloria, and she would be
given the leading rôle when the play was produced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>not so much because Terry wanted her, as because
she was the only well-known actress who could possibly
fit it.</p>

<p class='c007'>To hear the others talking one would think that
the play was going into rehearsals tomorrow with
all the parts distributed among Gloria’s friends.
Even Ben Stark begged Terry to try and hold out
one of the parts until he saw how his road tour was
coming out, and they were all discussing how the
various parts ought to be dressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry had no opportunity to talk to Ruth alone,
but they exchanged significant glances when George
appeared with tea, looking so correct and conventional
that it was difficult to believe that they had
seen him the night before burning incense and kneeling
to a snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any news?” Terry whispered, and Ruth could
only shake her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>When George had left the room Terry ventured
to speak of him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s all this that George is telling me about
going up to the Peyton-Russells’ with you to
amuse the guests with vaudeville magic?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he’s been telling!” exclaimed Gloria. “I
intended it to be a surprise. He’s really quite wonderful,
you know, or at least he was quite wonderful
if he hasn’t forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It can’t do any harm, my knowing, as I’m not
to be one of them,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“I’d get you an invitation, if there was
the slightest chance that you’d accept,” said
Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I’d like to go, just to see George.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Consider yourself invited then. Angela will ask
any one that I tell her I want. They’ve got loads of
room and men are never too numerous even in the
trail of the fair Angela.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think that George ought to go back
to his profession? If he’s as good as you say it
ought to be easy to get him signed up on the
Orpheum circuit. If he doesn’t know the ropes
here in the States I’ll be glad to help him,” said
Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It can’t be done—the biggest salary in the world
wouldn’t tempt George away from my service. It’s
the Eastern idea of gratitude. We had that all
argued out ten years ago. I told George that he
ought not to give up his career to serve me, but he
wouldn’t listen to me at all. He said that I had saved
his life, therefore it belonged to me. He almost
wept at the idea of having to go, and yet I sometimes
think that it is my life that belongs to
George instead of his life that belongs to me. He
is a most despotic servant and tries to rule all of my
actions. If my conduct displeases him he inconsistently
threatens to leave, but of course he doesn’t
mean it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria was smiling, reciting the peculiarities of an
amusing servant, but to Ruth her words were appalling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>She seemed to see Gloria as a bright
plumaged bird, charmed by a snake. Once, years
ago when she was a little girl visiting in the country,
she had seen a bird thus charmed, circling, circling,
downward toward the bright-eyed snake that waited
for it. She had been unable to move or help, as
fascinated as the bird itself. She felt the same sensation
of helplessness now. She dared not look at
Terry, but a few minutes later he came to her side
and whispered to her:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Meet me at Mori’s tomorrow at five.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had never heard of Mori’s, but she could look
it up in the telephone directory. Evidently Terry
had some plan. The thought cheered her immeasurably.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation in the house was a curious one, for
Amy shrank with terror whenever George came
near her, at the same time leaping to do his slightest
bidding. Ruth, so far as possible, ignored George
completely and he never spoke to her directly unless
it was absolutely necessary, and Gloria did not seem
to either observe or sense that there was a strained
atmosphere in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distrust of George and foreboding of the
future descended on Ruth the moment she entered
the house in the afternoon and remained with her,
colouring all her thoughts until she entered the Art
Students’ League in the morning. Here she forgot
everything in passionate pursuit of art, daily lifting
her ambition to higher ideals and daily seeming to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>demonstrate more and more her lack of talent for
the career which she had chosen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing her earnestness her fellow students strove
to help her, giving her advice and criticism and now
and then a word of encouragement, and Ruth, whose
confidence in herself was fast slipping, listened to
everything, following the advice last received and
struggling to “find herself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The thing that hurt her most was the fact that as
yet she had seemed to attract no particular notice
from her instructors. In Indianapolis she had been
rather important and she could not think that the
greater attention she had received there was entirely
due to there not being so large a number of
students. She longed to ask one of the instructors,
but it was hard to do that. They came through,
looked impersonally at her work and made brief
comments about drawing, proportion, composition,
etc. Finally the courage came to her very suddenly
in the portrait class one morning. She had come
early and was in the front row. Very slowly the
instructor, the most frank and vitriolic of all the
instructors, according to Nels, was coming toward
her. Suddenly she knew that she would speak to
him that day. As he stopped from time to time, her
courage did not desert her. She waited quite calmly
until he reached her side. She rose to let him have
her chair, and for some seconds he looked at her
work without speaking. Then he began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you see that your values are all wrong?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>And the entire figure is out of drawing; it’s a
caricature!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth listened almost without emotion. It was
as if he was speaking to some one else.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way,” continued the instructor, looking
up at her suddenly, “didn’t I see some work of
yours in one of the Sunday newspapers about a
month ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth nodded; she could not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so; I was pleased and surprised at
the time to see how much better your work in that
line was than anything you have done here. That’s
what is the trouble with this; it’s a cartoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I want to be a portrait painter; I’m interested
more in landscapes. Please tell me the truth.
Do you think I have talent—possibilities—will I
ever do anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her, frowning, yet with a half smile
on his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me first, what are you studying for? Are
you collecting canvases to take home and show
Mother, or do you intend to try for a career—to
make a profession of painting?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is my profession—I’ve never wanted to do
anything else—I must be a great painter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She spoke with almost hysterical intensity.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shadow passed over the instructor’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is difficult to say who has and who has not
talent. So far I have seen no signs of it in your
work here. Unquestionably you have the cartoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>gift, but as for painting—still a great desire may
do much. Rome wasn’t built in a day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had listened attentively, almost hopefully,
until those last words. Then she knew that he was
doing what Nels would have called “stalling.” He
did not believe that there was any chance for her.
He rose and went on about his tour of inspection,
and Ruth sank down into the empty chair. She did
not work any more, but sat still, looking at her
work, but not thinking of it—not thinking of anything.
She was roused by seeing the other students
filing out at the luncheon hour. She did not want to
see Nels and Dorothy; she would not go to their
restaurant, instead she would eat the “cheap and
wholesome” lunch offered in the building. There
she would be with strangers. She ate something, she
did not know what, and returned to her life class,
but again she could not work. She was beginning
to think definitely now. She had no talent—no
future. If she could not be a great artist, a great
painter, there was nothing in life for her. She didn’t
want anything else, not even love. If she could come
to Terry with a great gift, she would not stop hoping
that he would love her, but to be just an ordinary
woman—just a wife. If she was not to be a great
painter, then what was she to be? Very carefully
she went over every word of the professor. He had
admitted that it was difficult to say exactly whether
she had talent or not; he had only said that he had
discovered no signs of it. Yet he was only one man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Thousands of geniuses in every field of endeavour
had been discouraged by their elders simply because
the new genius worked in a different manner from
those who had gone before. But that didn’t apply to
herself. She had no new and original methods. She
changed her style of work every day in response to
something she had heard or had seen. She had no
knowledge, no ideas about art, in herself. Yet all
beginners must be swayed by what they saw and
heard, influenced by this or that painter from day to
day, until they found themselves. Then she
wondered if she had a self to find. She was vaultingly
ambitious; she was industrious and something
of a dreamer, but with all this Ruth was practical.
She thought of perpetual students—did she want to
become one of them? That was what it meant, following
a muse who had not called. Art is not
chosen. It chooses its own. Dorothy Winslow was
wrong—fame could not be achieved merely by ambition,
energy, and determination—neither is genius
the art of taking pains, she thought. Sometimes it
is achieved with infinite carelessness. The hour was
afternoon, class was over and she had not touched
crayon to paper. Not until she was on the street,
hurrying out to avoid speaking to Nels or Dorothy,
did she remember her engagement with Terry.
Mori’s was on Forty-second Street. If she walked
she would arrive at the right time. She was no
longer curious as to what Terry would have to say.
Gloria and George did not interest her. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>arrived at branching roads and she must choose. She
realized that. Not that she could not keep on with
her studies, regardless of whether she had talent or
not. She could, for she was responsible to no one.
No one counted on her to make good, nor was there
any one to warn her against mistakes. She only
knew that she did not want to devote her life to
something for which she was not intended. She did
not want to fail, even less did she want to be a
mediocre success. She must live on Olympus or in
the valley. It occurred to her that her very thoughts
were proof of her unworthiness. If she were really
a great artist she would not be thinking of either
fame or failure, but only of her work. She was
walking rapidly so that she arrived at Mori’s before
five. She glanced at the watch on her wrist before
entering and he was beside her, coming from the
opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On time,” he said with mock surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am ahead of time. I just came from the
League.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went in together—a big room crowded with
innumerable tiny tables and many people, yet when
she found herself seated opposite him, pouring tea,
they seemed to be quite alone together. Perhaps it
was because the tables were so tiny, perhaps because
of the small, soft, rose-shaded light on each one, that
she seemed to be nearer him than ever before, both
physically and spiritually.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were looking quite downcast when we met;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>I hope you aren’t worrying too much about George,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>His tone was friendly, intimate, comforting, inviting
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it’s not that. Much more selfish. I was
thinking of my own troubles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know you had any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it’s art. You know I have thought for
years—three years to be exact—that I would one
day be a great painter and today I discovered that I
have no talent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t know that; you’re discouraged over
some little failure. I don’t know anything about art,
but you’ve only been studying a few years and that’s
not time enough to tell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is—I’ve compared my work with that
of other students and I’ve been afraid for some time.
Today I asked Burroughs, one of the instructors,
and now I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that’s only one man’s opinion. Just what
did he say?—I know the pedagogue-al formula,
three words of praise and one of censure to keep you
from being too happy, or three words of adverse
criticism and one of praise to keep you from being
too discouraged. Wasn’t it like that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he just said very frankly that he would not
say that I had no future at all, but he did say that
if I had any my work at school had never given any
indication of it. He said my portraits looked like
cartoons, and then he remembered those awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>sketches in the <cite>Express</cite>—” She stopped embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never will live that down, will you?” said
Terry, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That isn’t fair, I didn’t mean that, only it’s all
so discouraging, to want to paint masterpieces and
to be told to draw cartoons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he tell you that?” Terry spoke eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not in so many words, but that’s what he
meant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he rather admired your ability to do cartoons?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why don’t you go in for that? One must
do something, you know—play some game and that
is better than most.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth did not answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you’d like I dare say you could do theatrical
caricatures for the Sunday <cite>Express</cite> every week. It
wouldn’t take much time. Of course you’d soon get
as fed up with the theatre as a dramatic critic, but
it would be interesting for a time and you could
continue to study, to take time to prove whether or
not you have talent. If you say I may, I’ll speak
to Daly about it the next time I see him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like it I think—after all, as Mr. Courtenay
said, it’s better to be a good cartoonist than a bad
painter, and I can always keep on studying. It will
not be exactly giving up my ambition, only I won’t
be gambling everything on it.” Then, as if half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>ashamed of her surrender, and wishing to change
the subject, “But we didn’t intend to talk about me,
we were going to talk about Gloria, weren’t we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it absolutely necessary that we should have
something very definite to talk about?” he asked,
smiling. “Suppose I just asked you to meet me
for tea, because.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Was he teasing her, she wondered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But now that we are together, because, let’s talk
about Gloria. I won’t know anything more about
Professor Pendragon until Sunday. I’m going
there with Dorothy Winslow, who is going to do a
portrait of him, but in the meantime I’d feel very
much happier if he was out of the house, or if not
George, at least the snake. Couldn’t you kill it,
Terry? That might make George so angry that he’d
leave. And anyway, the snake is the important thing.
Without the snake George would be comparatively
harmless. You must kill the snake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my dear girl, how do you propose that I am
to make away with George’s little pet? It belongs
to George, you know. I don’t even know where he
keeps it, and if I did it is his property and it wouldn’t
be legal, you know—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you wouldn’t laugh at me—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not laughing at you. Even if I can’t quite
believe all the things that you believe, I can still see
that the situation is serious, but I can’t see how
killing the snake would help any. My idea is a bit
different and perhaps quite as bizarre in its way.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>I’ve been thinking that if we could bring Gloria and
Professor Pendragon together again, then he would
take her away from George and the snake and save
us the trouble of taking George and the snake away
from her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds good, but there’s no way to do it.
I’ve given Gloria my word that I’ll not mention her
name to him and the other day she even made me
promise not to mention his name to her again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so, there must be other people who know
both of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s only been in America two years—they’d
move in different circles, naturally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but circles cross—and look here, those pictures
will be coming out soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t imagine he goes to the movies, certainly
not now that he’s ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but he reads the newspapers; he’ll see her
pictures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that isn’t meeting her. If he’s at all like
Gloria, he’ll be too proud to look her up; besides
we may be talking nonsense. How do we know that
they don’t really hate each other?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s not the worst. People don’t usually hate
over ten years. They may be utterly indifferent. I
realize that possibility, but I don’t believe they are
indifferent. It’s all just guessing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The simplest way would be to get rid of the
snake,” persisted Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know, but who’s to do it, and how?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“You’re to do it, and I suppose that I, being in
the house, should plan the means—find out where
he keeps his pet and how to kidnap it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even if it has the significance you suppose,
what’s to prevent him getting a new one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They don’t sell them in the department stores,
you know,” said Ruth, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s wait until you see Pendragon again before
we do anything rash,” Terry closed the discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came home with Ruth, who wondered if
Gloria would observe them coming together, and if
it might not wake in Gloria some latent jealousy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve persuaded Ruth to take up cartooning as
a profession,” he announced. His putting it into
words like that before all of them seemed to make
it final.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean those political things of fat capitalists
and paper-capped labouring men?” asked Ben
Stark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not,” said Terry. “You’re horribly
behind the times. That sort of thing isn’t done. If
she goes in for political cartoons at all she will draw
pictures of downtrodden millionaires defending
themselves from Bolsheviki, rampant on a field of
red, or of a mob of infuriated factory owners
throwing stones at the home of a labour leader—she
may draw a series of pictures showing in great
detail how a motion picture actress makes up to conceal
the wart on her nose before facing the camera.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t at all settled yet,” said Ruth. “I may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>not be able to get a—a job.” She hated the word,
but pronounced it in a perfect fury of democratic
renunciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think there’ll be any trouble,” said
Terry. “There’s always a demand for that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Altogether, however, the announcement produced
surprisingly little comment from Gloria and her
friends. They seemed to take it as a matter of
course, like Gloria’s going into motion pictures. She
had been, despite her fears, rather successful, and
had been offered a new contract, which, however,
she was unwilling to sign until she knew more about
the production of Terry’s comedy. If Terry’s play
really got a New York production, Gloria would
be only too glad to desert the camera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The revelation of Ruth’s duplicity to Professor
Pendragon was threatened in a most unexpected
manner, Sunday morning. First Dorothy called for
her at the house, and this time, manifested more curiosity
about her surroundings than she had done
previously, because this time her mind was not on the
more important matter of frocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who do you live with here?” she asked Ruth,
as she waited for her to put on her hat and
coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth hesitated; she hated deception of any kind,
or making mysteries. After all it was very silly of
Gloria. If one must leave ex-husbands scattered
around the world, one should contemplate the possibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of running across them now and then with
equanimity. And then the stupid idea of concealing
their relationship. It was all most annoying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With a woman who was a friend of my father,”
she answered at last, but Dorothy was not to be put
off so easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean what’s her name?” she asked with
frank curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria Mayfield—she’s really my aunt,” said
Ruth with a desperate realization that she might as
well speak now as have her secret come out later
under less favourable circumstances. After all,
Dorothy didn’t know that Pendragon was one of
Gloria’s husbands and she might not mention their
relationship to him anyway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The actress?” asked Dorothy, with a rising inflection
composed of astonishment, envy, and doubt
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uh—huh.” She tried not to be pleased at the
look in Dorothy’s blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s in pictures, isn’t she, now? I saw her
picture in at least three newspapers this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—I’ve not seen any newspapers
this morning,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will I meet her?” asked Dorothy. She was a
most distressingly natural and unaffected person.
She always said what she thought and asked for
what she wanted without the slightest effort at concealment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare say you will if you come often enough.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>She’s asleep now, but she’s not at all difficult to
meet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I could paint her,” again suggested
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think Gloria could sit still long enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Things were developing too rapidly for Ruth.
She had known that Dorothy would be interested,
but she had not thought that her interest
would take this turn, though she might have guessed,
for Dorothy looked at everything and every person
as so much available material. She worked incessantly
with both hands and brain. She didn’t just
study art; she lived it in the most practical manner
possible. She was becoming quite well known as a
fashion artist and could have been busy all the time,
had she not continued her studies. As it was she
did quite as much work as many fashion artists who
devoted all their time to it. And she never for a
moment let herself think that being a fashion artist
today would debar her from becoming a famous
portrait painter tomorrow. She was building high
hopes on Professor Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way to his hotel Ruth told her about her
decision to go in for cartooning professionally, and
she rather hoped that Dorothy would discourage her,
but she was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Splendid! You’re doing the right thing. You
know I don’t think you’ll ever get any place with
painting. Nels thinks that, too, but you have a
genius for caricature. Those things in the <cite>Express</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>were really clever. Lots of character and good action.
You’ll be famous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Famous!” Ruth put as much scorn as possible
into the one word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course—beginning with Cruickshank there
have been ever so many caricature artists in the last
two centuries whose names will last as long and
longer than most of the painters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth did not respond to this. She was wondering
if after all she might not one day, not only be
reconciled to the work destiny had given her, but be
actually rather proud of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were expected by Professor Pendragon and
were conducted immediately to his apartment, but
when the boy knocked at his door, he did not open
it as on the former occasion, instead they were met
by a white uniformed nurse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Pendragon begs to be excused from
his appointment. He is very much worse. The
paralysis has extended from his knee to his hip. He
asked me to say that he will be glad to make good
his promise as soon as he is well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of this announcement was bad enough
on Dorothy, who naturally was bitterly disappointed,
but its effect on Ruth was much worse.
Professor Pendragon’s misfortune had fallen upon
him on the night that she first watched George, and
a repetition of George’s ceremonial had brought
with it the increased misfortune to him that she had
feared. She was eager to hurry away and find an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>opportunity to tell Terry of this new development,
but Dorothy lingered at the door, expressing sympathy,
which Ruth suspected was more for herself
than for Professor Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Pendragon called to the nurse to let
them come in. He was propped up on a chaise
longue, with newspapers and the remains of breakfast
scattered about on the floor and on a low table
beside him. His face was very pale and Ruth
thought that he looked as if he had not slept. She
tried not to look at some photographs of Gloria
prominently displayed on the scattered sheets. Evidently
he had seen them, so now he knew that she
was in New York, or at least in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m awfully sorry to disappoint you and myself.
But you see a man can’t have his portrait painted in
a pose like this,” he said. “I can’t imagine what’s
wrong with me, but of course it won’t last long. A
friend of mine has asked me out to his place in the
Berkshires and I think I’ll go. Perhaps this may
be the result of nerves, and anyway, lots of cold air
and altitude and quiet can’t do any harm. When I
return I’ll be very glad to make good, but perhaps
by that time you will have so many commissions that
you won’t have time for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No chance,” said Dorothy. “I shall be waiting
for you.” And then: “How long do you think it
will be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll know definitely after Christmas eve,
next dark of the moon, you know.” He was smiling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the smile that Ruth had grown to suspect hid a serious
thought. “Either the paralysis will have crept
up to my heart, or it will have gone entirely. I am
waiting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dorothy laughed nervously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What nonsense; of course you’ll get well and the
moon hasn’t anything to do with it anyway. We’re
awfully sorry that you’re ill, and don’t forget to let
me know when you get back to town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Ruth took his hand to say good-bye she
thought he looked at her reproachfully, but she
dared not meet his eyes. Dorothy was looking down
at the pictured face of Gloria that was smiling up
at them, but apparently she looked with unseeing
eyes, for she did not say anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a way it would have relieved Ruth’s conscience
if Dorothy had spoken. She might then have discovered
whether Pendragon knew of her deception
and what he thought. One thing she knew. Professor
Pendragon was really facing death—a mysterious,
relentless death that could not be overcome
or even combated. When he died no one would
search for his murderer—no one would believe that
his death was anything but natural, and the force
that had killed him would still go on through the
world, too mysterious and unbelievable for modern
minds to compass.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>It was the first time that Ruth had seen Prince
Aglipogue, though apparently he was on the
most congenial and intimate terms of friendship
with Gloria. He was at the piano now, accompanying
himself, while he sang in Italian. He had
glossy black eyes, glossy red lips, glossy black hair,
smooth glossy cheeks and what Terry described as
a grand opera figure. He was a Roumanian, and
while he sang magnificently, was a passable pianist
and a really good violinist, he was at present earning
his living as a painter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria had finished her motion picture contract
and was relaxing. Ruth had just come home from
the League and found Gloria, Terry, Billie Irwin,
Prince Aglipogue and Angela Peyton-Russell at the
house. Ben Stark had at last started out on tour,
or he would also have been there. Ruth often thought
that her aunt’s house was more like a club than a
home. Of course Ruth did not immediately learn
all the foregoing details about Prince Aglipogue,
whom Gloria called Aggie, and the others called
Prince. Her information came in scraps gathered
from the conversation of the others. She had
slipped quietly into the room while Prince Aglipogue
was singing and was introduced to him when he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>finished. He bowed with surprising depth and grace
for a man with no waist line to speak of, and regarded
her out of his glossy, black eyes. He spoke
entirely without accent, but constructed his sentences
curiously, Ruth thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>As always when there were many people Ruth
did not talk, but listened. Mrs. Peyton-Russell had
come to talk over with Gloria the details of her
Christmas party. As at present arranged she would
have one more man than woman, and it appeared
that her party must be conducted strictly on the Ark
principle, with pairs. She was deeply distressed.
She had invited Billie Irwin in a patronizing burst of
generosity, but Billie had also secured an engagement
that would take her out of town and could not
come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know who to have,” Angela complained.
“Of course there are dozens of people I could ask,
but I wanted this to be just our little Bohemian
circle—no swank, no society people—just friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one seemed to mind this remark. George had
come in with a tea wagon and the Prince was engaged
in the, to Ruth, alarming, procedure of drinking
whiskey and soda and eating cake. Witnessing
this catholic consumption of refreshment she could
easily conceive that an invitation to any party under
any circumstances, would be welcome to him. As
for Gloria, she was accustomed to Angela, and did
not mind her airs. Since her marriage Angela had
consistently referred to all her old friends as “our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>little Bohemian circle,” a circle, to which she was
constantly reverting for amusement, after unsuccessful
attempts to gain access to the more conventional
circles described as Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Angela’s heart is as good as her complexion,”
Gloria always said, and that was indeed high praise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just tea, please, Gloria,” Angela was saying.
“I never drink anything stronger any more—no,
no real principle, but people in our position must set
an example, you know. Not sweets—I really don’t
dare, well just a tiny bit. You know there is a tendency
to stoutness in our family.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is, I suppose, in that, nothing personal,”
said Prince Aglipogue, hastily swallowing a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit
fours</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela laughed gaily. She pretended to believe
everything the Prince said to be extremely clever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that doesn’t solve my problem,” said Angela.
“You are all to come up on the Friday night
train. We’ll meet you at the station at North
Adams. You must be sure and dress warmly, because
it’s a twenty-mile drive through the hills and
while there’ll be lots of robes in the sleigh, one
can’t have too much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will remind me of Russia,” said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll be sure to bring your violin and some
music,” said Angela.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Aglipogue assented carelessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I really think it will be tremendously successful,”
said Angela, “not a dull person in the party,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>only John has invited one of his friends—he’s coming
up early. I forget his name, but anyway I haven’t
the slightest idea what he’s like and he makes my
party uneven. Come to think, though, John said
something about his being ill—lungs, I suppose, so
perhaps he won’t want to talk to any one. Anyway
I’ll try and think of some one congenial before it’s
too late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She rambled on, sipping her tea and forgetting
her diet to the extent of two more cakes, while
George moved in and out among them apparently
a model of what a perfect servant could be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you’ll sing for us,” she demanded of
the Prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will inspire my best efforts,” he assured her,
looking at Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’ll be sure to have some clever stories,
Mr. Riordan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently every one would have to pay for their
entertainment. Ruth wondered if she would be
expected to draw.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the best part of the entertainment is to be
a secret.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid it isn’t to most of them,” said Gloria.
“Professional pride got the better of George’s
discretion and he told Terry and Terry told
Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” asked the Prince, evidently fearing
a rival attraction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s George,” explained Gloria. “He used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>be a music hall magician and he’s going to do his
tricks for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” Prince Aglipogue shrugged his fat
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t be so scornful when you’ve seen him.
He was one of the best and if he hasn’t forgotten
he’ll astonish you. George is a Hindoo, you know,
and he doesn’t need a lot of props to work with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he is working here as your—as your butler.”
It was indeed difficult to classify George.
His duties were so numerous and varied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Aggie, as my butler, footman, and he will
be cook and maid as well, I’m afraid, for Amy has
given notice. She’s leaving at the end of the week,
unless Ruth can persuade her to stay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why Ruth?” asked Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. Servants always have favourites
and while George is devoted to me, Amy is devoted
to Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Devotion? Among servants!” Angela threw
out her hands in a despairing gesture and then
launched forth on a discussion of servants to which
no one paid much attention, with the possible exception
of Billie Irwin, who listened to every one on
every subject, showing her keen attention to their
words by sundry nods, smiles, and shakes of the
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela was taking Gloria away with her to dinner
and Prince Aglipogue, finally having consumed
the last scrap of cake, and convinced that he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>not be asked to come with them, took his departure.
Billie Irwin went up to her room to rest,
Gloria and Angela went away and Terry also departed,
leaving Ruth alone. She rather hated these
evenings when Gloria was away and she had to dine
alone. Amy usually served her on these occasions,
George hardly thinking that one person at the table
justified his appearance. She was wondering whether
she should tell her not to trouble with dinner and go
out, when George came in to take away the tea
things. Ruth was almost as much afraid of George
as Amy, but she nerved herself to speak to him now,
because she questioned whether she would again
have such a good opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is your pet?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said George, capturing a
glass from the piano and a tea cup from the floor
with what looked like one movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean the snake that you use in your—in your
tricks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not perform <i>tricks</i> with the daughter of
Shiva.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you said you were rehearsing the day Mr.
Riordan and I looked in on you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You knew that I was not speaking the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he talked he went on about his duties. There
was in his attitude toward her nothing of the servant.
He did not pronounce her name once, but
spoke as one speaks to an equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should I think that you were speaking anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>but the truth? If you were not telling the
truth I must speak to Miss Mayfield. I don’t think
she would like the idea of having a snake in the
house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He put down the cup in his hand and turned to
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mayfield is well aware that the daughter
of Shiva is with me. She has been with me since
my birth and was with my father before me, and
she is sacred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“George, you ought to be ashamed to believe all
that superstition—an educated—” she stopped, the
word nigger on her lips—“man like you. It’s
nothing short of idolatry.” She was trying to talk
to him as she would have scolded at one of her
mother’s coloured servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You prefer the mythology of the Hebrews?”
asked George.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth decided to ignore this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now you’ve frightened poor Amy so that
she is leaving. That ought to concern you, for it may
be some time before Miss Mayfield can find any one
to take her place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is of no importance, for on the first of the
year the house will revert to its original owner and
she will not need servants. She will be travelling with
her new husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her what?” Ruth forgot that she was talking
to George. She stared at him wide eyed, unwilling
to believe that she had heard him rightly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>His blue lips curled up in a thin smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly—wait and you will see that I am
right. She herself does not know it, but she will
marry Prince Aglipogue on the first of the new
year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She will do nothing of the sort—she can’t—he’s
fat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth was protesting not to George but to herself,
for even against her reason she believed everything
George said to her. He shrugged his shoulders,
still smiling at her, and it seemed to her that the iris
of his eyes was red, concentrating in tiny points of
flame at the pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are speaking foolishly out of the few years
of your present existence; back of that you have the
unerring knowledge of many incarnations and you
know that what I say is true. Has she not already
had three husbands? I tell you she will have one
more before she finally finds her true mate. She
has suffered, but before she knows the truth she
must suffer more. Through the Prince she will
come to poverty and disgrace, and when these things
are completed she will see her true destiny and follow
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A mist was swimming before Ruth’s eyes so that
she no longer saw the room or the figure of George—only
his red eyes glowed in the deepening shadows
of the room, holding her own. She struggled to
move her gaze, but her head would not turn; she
tried to rise, to leave him as if his words were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>silly ravings of a demented servant, but her limbs
were paralysed. Only her lips moved and she heard
words coming from them, or echoing in her brain.
She could not be sure that she really made a sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the whole world there are only two men who
are fit to walk beside her—and of those one is
slowly dying of an unknown disease. He whom the
gods chose will soon be gone, but I remain because I
have knowledge. In the <cite>Mahabharata</cite> it is written,
‘Even if thou art the greatest sinner among all
that are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over all transgressions
by the raft of knowledge,’ and the Vedas
tell of men who armed with knowledge have defied
the gods themselves—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused and turned on her almost fiercely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think that I have renounced my caste,
that I have lived with the unclean and served the
unclean for nothing—the price has been too high
for me to lose—but no price will seem too high after
I have won!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ruth woke to find herself alone and in darkness,
save for the light from the street lamps that shone
through the curtained windows. With her hands
stretched out in front of her to ward off obstacles
she moved cautiously through the room until she
found a light to turn on. She felt weak and dizzy,
but she remembered everything that George had
said. It could not be true—it could not, but with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>her denials she still heard George’s voice speaking
of the raft of knowledge and she half remembered
the incomprehensible contradictions of Indian mythology—of
heroes and holy Brahmans who had
actually fought with gods and conquered, but these
men had only won power through self-denial. Possibly
George thought that by living as a servant for
eleven years he was performing austerities—possibly
did not know what he believed. Certainly modern
Hindoos did not believe as he did. His mind seemed
to be a confused mass of knowledge and superstition,
ancient and modern, but one thing he had—faith
and absolute confidence in his power, and she
remembered some words she had read, when, as a
child, she pored over books of mythology instead
of fairy tales: “All this, whatever exists, rests absolutely
on mind,” and “That man succeeds whom
thus knowing the power of austere abstraction, practises
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was roused from her thoughts by the entrance
of Amy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ain’ yo’ goin’ eat dinnah? That voodoo man,
he’s gone out, an’ I saw you-all sleepin’ here and
didn’t like to disturb yo’. Yo’ dinnah’s cold by now,
but I’ll warm it up—now he’s gone I ain’ ’fraid to
go in the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not hungry, Amy, and I’m sorry you’re
going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dat’s all right. I ain’ so anxious fo’ wu’k as
that. I don’ haf to wu’k with devils. An’ yo’ bettah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>eat. You-all too thin. It’s a shame you-all havin’
ter eat alone heah while Mis’ Glorie go out to
pahties. She don’ treat yo’ like folks. Dat devil
man he’s hoodooed her. I’ve seen him lookin’ at
her with his red eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She went on muttering and returned with dinner
on a tray, and Ruth knowing the uselessness of resistance
dutifully ate, while Amy hovered near.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me all about it, Amy. What has George
been doing now? I thought you would be satisfied
when I let you sleep upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I ain’ satisfied nohow. I wouldn’t wu’k
heah or sleep heah ’nother night not for all the
money in the worl’. Dat man he sets an’ sets lookin’
at nothin’ an’ then he runs knives inter his hans—an’
he don’ bleed. He ain’ human—that’s what.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry, Amy—I don’t want you to go and
neither does Gloria, but of course we can’t keep you.
Let me know if you don’t get another place or if
anything goes wrong. Perhaps later George may go
and then you can come back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He won’t go. One mawnin’ you-all will wake
up dade—that’s what goin’ happen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shook her head, looking at Ruth with real
tears in her eyes. Apparently she thought she looked
at one doomed to early death, and Ruth, though she
knew the threatened evil was not for herself, had
long since lost the ability to laugh at Amy’s superstitions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Terry Riordan arranged an interview
for Ruth with the Sunday editor of the
<cite>Express</cite>, with the result that she found herself
promised to do a weekly page of theatrical
sketches, beginning the first of the year, and she
discovered the unique joy of having real work which
was wanted and for which she would receive money.
Also she discovered that association with a newspaper
and connection with a weekly stipend gave her
a prestige with her fellow students which no amount
of splendid amateur effort would have won for her.
Dorothy and Nels told every one they knew about
“Ruth Mayfield’s splendid success,” and Professor
Burroughs congratulated her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is always sad to see a student with a real
gift neglecting it for a fancied talent,” he said, “and
it is equally satisfying when any of our students
wisely follow the line of work for which they are
fitted. We don’t want to turn out dabblers, and too
often that’s what art students become.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth would have looked forward to the beginning
of the next year eagerly, had she been thinking only
of herself, for her new work was throwing her much
in the company of Terry Riordan, who was taking
her to the theatre every night, so that she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>become familiar with the appearance and mannerisms
of the popular actresses and actors. Of course
he was doing it only because he was such a kind-hearted
man and because he wanted to help her, but
even Ruth knew that if she had not been a rather
pleasant companion he would not have taken so much
interest in helping her. His cheerfulness puzzled
her. He seemed so brave and happy—but perhaps
it was merely the forced gaiety of a man who is trying
to forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not, however, her own affairs that interested
her most. Terry had found a producer for
his play and despite the lateness of the season, rehearsals
for it were to begin in January. Gloria
had been offered the leading rôle, and with characteristic
perverseness had said that she was not at
all sure that she wanted it, information that Terry
refused to convey to the manager. This, coupled
with the fact that Gloria was now constantly in the
company of Prince Aglipogue, made Ruth remember
vividly her conversation with George. Her beauty,
her restlessness, her changeful moods seemed to increase
from day to day. She was always kind to
Ruth, but she was very seldom with her. Invitations
that a month before would have been thrown away
unread were now accepted and Gloria dashed about
from one place to another, always with Prince Aglipogue
in her wake. His ponderous attentions seemed
to surround her like a cage and she, like a darting
humming-bird, seemed ever to be struggling to escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and ever recognizing the bars that enclosed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry and Ruth, returning very late from supper
after the theatre, would sometimes find her sitting
in semi-darkness, while the Prince sang to her, but
in such brief glimpses there was no chance for intimate
conversation between the two women. Alone
with Terry at the theatre or in some restaurant, Ruth
almost forgot the shadow hanging over the house
on Gramercy Park. Terry was so gay and amusing,
so healthful and normal in his outlook, and wherever
they went they met his friends, until Ruth began to
feel like a personage. It was all very pleasant. Late
hours had forced her to appear less and less often
at the morning class, but she was always at the
League in the afternoon and she began to wonder
whether she would not give it up altogether as soon
as she actually began her work for the <cite>Express</cite>. She
had tried to tell Terry about her talk with George;
but a few hours away from George and his snake
worship and the sight of George in his rôle of
servant had restored what Terry called his mental
balance, and he no longer regarded him as dangerous.
He was beginning to be a bit ashamed of even
listening to Ruth’s fears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s only natural that you should be nervous—that
we should both have been a bit impressed, it
was so weird and unexpected, but after all George
is just a servant, and the snake is probably a harmless
reptile, such as one sees in any circus. I do not think
that he is a bad servant and that he does not regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Gloria as a servant should; he’s impertinent and disagreeable,
if you like, but I don’t believe he has the
slightest thing to do with Professor Pendragon’s
illness. How could he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He talked thus until Ruth despaired of securing
his assistance. Terry had given Gloria a contract
to sign, which she persistently refused to consider.
Finally he appealed to Ruth about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t you make Gloria sign it?” he said. “She
seemed keen enough before we found a producer and
before the thing was cast, and now that she has the
contract before her, she seems to have lost all interest.
I can’t imagine what’s wrong. Of course temperament
covers a multitude of sins, but she never
was temperamental about her work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps she’s decided to really abandon the
stage,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were having supper together—Ruth didn’t
know where. One of the delightful things about
Terry was that he never asked her where she wanted
to go. He didn’t even tell her where they were
going. He just took her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry looked at her in amazement. “Leave the
stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did it ever occur to you that Gloria might marry
Prince Aglipogue?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry answered with a laugh:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child, you’ve thought so much about
Gloria and George that you’re beginning to think of
impossibilities. Gloria wouldn’t marry a man like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>that, and if she did she’d have to stay on the stage
to support him. The house, of course, belongs to
her, but the income from her other husband—I
forget his name—would certainly stop if she remarried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know; I thought it was preposterous too, but
she’s always with him, and George told me that
Gloria would marry Aglipogue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Servants’ gossip, or perhaps he did it to annoy
you. Did you tell Gloria?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I never get a chance to talk to her any
more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you told her it might make her angry enough
to dismiss him. Gloria hates being discussed. Is
the Prince going to the Christmas party?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course; he goes everywhere that Gloria goes.
I know you think that I am foolish and superstitious,
but I can’t help thinking that George has some
power over Gloria—that what he says is true—that
he’s forcing her to marry Prince Aglipogue and that
he is responsible for Professor Pendragon’s strange
illness. The first time I saw George with the snake
was almost three months ago—that same night Professor
Pendragon became paralysed; the next time
was just a month later and at the same time Professor
Pendragon’s paralysis became suddenly worse.
It was at the dark of the moon—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The last words were spoken almost in a whisper
and when she paused Terry did not speak, but sat
waiting for her to go on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“I know George hasn’t worshipped the snake
since that time, for I’ve been in the house every night
and you can always tell because of the incense that
fills the hall and lingers there for hours. Christmas
Eve will be the next dark of the moon. I know, for
I’ve looked it up. We’ll all be in the Berkshires
then, at the Peyton-Russells’. George will be there,
too—and I’m afraid—I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry still sat silent looking at her with an expression
of helpless amazement. His blue eyes were
troubled and doubting and she knew that while he
did not quite disbelieve her, he was by no means
convinced, that her fears were justified. It was all
too bizarre and unusual. The only trace of fear
in his eyes was for herself, not for Gloria, or Professor
Pendragon. She had been bending eagerly
toward him. Now she sank back with a little helpless
sigh. Instantly Terry’s hand reached across the
table and caught her own in a comforting grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me what you want me to do, Ruth; I’ll
do anything. I’ll do anything for you—anything in
or out of reason. I don’t understand all this talk
about snakes and black magic, but whatever you
want done, you can depend on me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood rushed into Ruth’s cheeks in a glow of
happiness. Something deeper than friendship
thrilled in his voice. For a moment she forgot
Gloria, and believed that she was looking into the
eyes of her own acknowledged lover. Then she remembered.
His words, even his eyes told her that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>he did, but it could not be true. For a moment she
could not speak. She must think of Gloria first and
herself afterward, but she wanted to prolong her
dream a little while. Finally she told him what she
had decided in her own mind was the only thing
that Terry could do for her. She knew that he did
not believe that George was menacing the life of
Professor Pendragon, or that he was influencing
Gloria to marry Prince Aglipogue, but even though
he did not love her, he would do whatever she
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want you to get me a revolver, Terry; I want
a revolver—one of those little ones—before we go
to the Christmas party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not quite understand the curious “let
down” expression on Terry’s face, when she made
her request.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t want to shoot George or the snake?”
he asked, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to shoot any one or any thing
unless—anyway I’d feel much more comfortable if
I had a little revolver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall have one; I’ll call it a Christmas
present; but can you shoot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. I suppose I could hit things if
they weren’t too far away or too small.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you accidentally kill any of your friends I
shall feel morally responsible, but I suppose I’ll just
have to take a chance. Do you by any chance want
the thing to be loaded?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Of course,” said Ruth, ignoring his frivolous
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went home together almost in silence. Ruth
did not know what occupied Terry’s thoughts, but
she herself was wondering if she could find the courage
to ask Terry to save Gloria from George and
Aglipogue, by marrying her himself. It was all very
well to be unselfish in love, but for some weeks at
least it seemed to her that Terry had given up all
effort to interest Gloria. If he would only make
an effort he might save Gloria from the Prince and
win happiness for himself, but despite her generous
resolves, she could not bring herself to advise him
to “speak for himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They could hear Prince Aglipogue singing as she
unlocked the door of the house on Gramercy Square.
The sound of his voice and the piano covered the
opening and closing of the door, so that they stood
looking in on Gloria and her guest without themselves
being observed. The song was just ending—Prince
Aglipogue at the piano, her eyes wide and if
she heard the music she did not see the singer. There
was a trance-like expression in her eyes and when,
the song ending, they saw Aglipogue draw her to
the seat beside him and lift his face to kiss her, with
one movement Terry and Ruth drew back toward
the outer door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guess I’d better go,” whispered Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; you saw George was right. They didn’t
see us—don’t forget my revolver.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>She closed the door after Terry, this time with a
loud bang that could not fail to be heard and as she
turned back she saw, far down the hall, two red eyes
gleaming at her, like the eyes of a cat. She wondered
if George had been watching too, and if his
quick ears caught her whispered words to Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria called her name before she entered the
room, almost like old times, but Prince Aglipogue
did not seem to be particularly pleased to see her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were singing,” she said to him. “Please
don’t stop because I’ve come. I love to hear
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, but it is late for more music; and
it is late, too, for little girls who study, to be up
even for the sake of music.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even a week ago he would not have dared speak
to her like that. He sat staring at her now, out of
his insolent, oily black eyes, as if she were really a
troublesome child. For a moment anger choked her
voice and she half expected Gloria to speak for her,
but Gloria was still looking at Aglipogue, the strange
trance-like expression in her eyes, and Ruth became
calm. If Prince Aglipogue chose to be rude she
could be impervious to rudeness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not trying to make the morning classes any
more, Prince Aglipogue, so I can stay up as long
as I like, but perhaps you’re tired of singing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Aglipogue who looked at Gloria now as
if he expected her to send Ruth away, but she said
nothing, sitting quite still with her long hands folded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>in her lap, a most uncharacteristic pose, and a faint
smile on her lips. She seemed to have forgotten
both of them. It seemed incredible that less than
five minutes before Ruth had seen her bend her head
to meet the lips of the fat singer—incredible and
horrible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’m tired—of singing,” said Aglipogue
after a pause. He rose and lifted one of Gloria’s
lovely hands and kissed it. Simultaneously George
appeared at the door with his hat and stick. It
seemed to Ruth that under his air of great deference
and humility George was sneering at the Prince.
Gloria, seemingly only half roused from her trance
or reverie, rose also in farewell and seemed to
struggle to concentrate on her departing guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tomorrow,” he said, bending again over her
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He went out without again speaking to Ruth, who
waited breathless until she heard the closing of the
outer door. Gloria watched him disappear, and
then lifted her arms high above her head, stretching
her superb body up to its full length like a great
Persian cat just waking from a nap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing up at this hour, Ruth?”
She spoke as if seeing Ruth for the first time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went to the theatre with Terry, you know, and
then we went to supper afterward and I came in
fifteen minutes ago. I’m not a bit tired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am, horribly, of everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“It’s only Prince Aglipogue who’s been boring
you. No wonder you’re tired of him. If he’d only
sing behind a curtain so that one didn’t have to look
at him, he would be quite lovely,” said Ruth. She
spoke thus with the intention of making Gloria tell
what she really thought of the Prince. Gloria
sank back on her chair by the piano and rested her
chin on her folded hands, her elbows on her knees.
Unlike most large women she seemed able to assume
any attitude she chose without appearing ungraceful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t like Aggie, do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was looking at Ruth now with something of
her normal expression in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t exactly dislike him,” said Ruth. “He’s
all right as a singer or a pianist or a painter, but as
a man he is singularly uninteresting, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is horribly stupid—I—” Suddenly her expression
changed and she was on her feet again,
walking restlessly up and down the room: “I’m
going to marry him; he’s going to South America on
a concert tour and I’ll go with him—I’m so tired of
everything; I want to get away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Involuntarily Ruth had also risen, bewildered at
the sudden change in Gloria’s manner. Through
the open doorway she could see George standing in
the dimly lighted hall beyond, his red eyes gleaming,
fixed on Gloria’s moving figure. She thought she
understood, at least in part, the reason for the sudden
change and though she was trembling with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>unreasoning fear that assails the bravest in the face
of the mysterious and unknown, she forced herself
to move across the room so that she stood between
George in the hall, and Gloria. She could almost
feel his malignant gaze on her back as she stood in
the doorway, but she did not falter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you do that, Gloria, it will mean that you
can’t work in Terry’s play—It will mean giving up
everything—your career and your income. Does
Prince Aglipogue know that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria paused in her restless walk and looked at
her from beneath her troubled brows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care about the career; I’m tired of the
stage, but what difference will the income make?
It’s such a little one, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still it may make a difference with Aglipogue,
and if you give up your career and your income you
will be dependent on him. That should make a difference
to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth wondered afterward where she got all this
worldly knowledge and how she was able to say it,
with George’s eyes burning into her back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a practical child you are; but let’s not
talk about it tonight. I’m awfully tired. We were
going to announce our engagement Christmas Eve,
but there’s no harm in your knowing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria, you can’t—you can’t marry him. He’s
fat and selfish and horrid!” In her excitement she
forgot George and moved to Gloria’s side. “You
don’t know what you’re doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Gloria’s eyes looked across her, over her head
and the trance-like look came back into them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you are as old as I you will know that
physical appearance doesn’t matter much. I don’t
know why I’m marrying Aggie, but it seems to be
happening. So many things happen—I need a
change; I want to travel in a new country. Besides
it’s all fixed—it’s too late now—too late—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She threw off Ruth’s detaining hands and swept
past her through the hall and up the stairway, and
Ruth did not try to follow her. Somewhere beyond
the shadows she knew that George was still standing,
his red eyes gleaming like those of a cat. She waited
a few minutes to give Gloria time to go to her room
and to give him time to retire to his own quarters.
She did not want to pass him in the hall, and when
at last she also went up, she thought she caught the
sounds of suppressed sobs, coming from Gloria’s
room. It would do no good to stop. In two days
more they would be going to the Berkshires and
there either George would win in his curious twisted
plans or she would defeat him. If only she knew
where to find Professor Pendragon. Terry could
not help. He was too modern and practical. He
couldn’t understand, his mind was fresh and clean
and honest and western. If she could see Pendragon
again she would tell him everything and he
might help. She decided to telephone his hotel in
the morning and find out, if possible, just where he
had gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>When Ruth telephoned Professor Pendragon’s
hotel she found that he had not
left any address and would not be expected
back before the first of the year. Her next thought
was of Nels Zord. He might know, but much to
her surprise she did not see Nels at the League, and
sought out Dorothy instead. She found her easily
enough, but it was not until she had asked about
Nels that she observed that Dorothy’s eyes were red
and her cheeks swollen as if from recent weeping.
It was luncheon time and they were walking toward
their restaurant together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know where Nels is,” said Dorothy.
Her voice was almost a sob.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t you seen him today?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never see him any more—haven’t you seen?
He’s too busy with that Alice Winn girl. Oh, you
know her, Ruth, the insipid creature with the carefully
nurtured southern accent, who always has some
highbrow Russian or Swedish book under her arm,
and begins reading it every time she thinks a man is
looking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I know the one you mean, but what about
her and why is Nels busy with her and why have you
been crying? You <i>have</i> been crying.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“I suppose I have; it’s most unmanly of me, but
I must do something. All men you know are irresistibly
attracted to the weakest, cheapest sort of
women. They all prefer sham to reality, and they
are all snobs at heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I don’t know much about men,” admitted
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m telling you about them now. You
might as well know. And the better a man is the
more he likes imitation women, and Nels is just as
bad as any of them, and that’s why he’s fallen so
hard for Alice Winn. First he fell for the highbrow
books. He really believes that she reads ’em.
Then she told him all about her aristocratic family
in Kentucky, who fought and fought to keep her
from being an artist, but she must ‘live her own
life,’ even if she had to brave the hardships of a
great city with not a thing to live on except the income
she gets from home. And then, of course, she
scorns everything except real art—she would never
stoop to a fashion drawing or commercial art of any
kind. Her artistic temperament would not allow it.
She is working on a mural—yes, indeed—of course
it never has and never will go any further than a
rough sketch and a lot of conversation in her comfortable
studio, but Nels doesn’t know that. He and
every other man she talks to believes that she is
really working on something big. And then she is
<i>such</i> a lover of beauty. She must have flowers in
her studio at all times. She simply couldn’t live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>without flowers. And Nels—Nels who never
bought me even a bunch of violets at Easter time—is
pawning his clothes to buy her roses. I think
that’s what hurts most. I’m just a practical old
thing, and I’ve never wanted to do anything at all
but work with him and for him, and go to dinner
with him ‘Dutch’—and so you see I am of no value—and
she, who has never done a useful thing in her
whole life, has completely fascinated him. He isn’t
worth all this. I ought not to care—I don’t care—I’m
just plain angry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tears were overflowing the blue eyes of the
“just plain angry” girl and Ruth feared a public
exhibition. They had reached the restaurant and
she feared the curious eyes inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s not eat here today, Dorothy. You need
a change, that’s all, so why not take the afternoon
off? We could go to your studio. I’ve never been
there, you know. Couldn’t we have lunch there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We could buy it at the ‘delly’ ’round the corner,”
said Dorothy, her round face clearing a bit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And let’s buy some flowers first; if Nels shows
up we can pretend a man sent them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s ‘woman stuff’; I don’t think I ought—but—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just for this once,” persisted Ruth, leading the
way into the nearest flower shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like to have you spend money on me.
I don’t like to have anything that I can’t pay for
myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“That’s selfish, and vain. Perhaps that’s why
Nels is with Alice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose so. You know they’re so stupid, men.
They believe everything you tell them. I’ve told
Nels what a practical worker I am and how independent
I am and he believes me, without ever trying
to prove it; and she’s told him that she is an
impractical, artistic dreamer and he believes that,
too, though if he’d only think for just a minute he’d
know that she’s a mercenary schemer, not an artistic
dreamer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you like these pink ones?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, and those unusual pale yellow roses—the
combination is wonderful, and the scent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She buried her nose in the flowers in an ecstasy
of delight that made her forget that Ruth was paying
for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now we’ll ride down on the ’bus,” said Ruth.
“But you haven’t told me just where Nels is—is
Alice Winn pretty?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Questions of this sort are perfectly intelligible to
women and Dorothy answered in her own way as
they climbed into the Fifth Avenue ’bus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone with her to the Met—to look over
some costumes she wants to use in this mural she’s
supposed to be doing; and of course she is pretty—an
anæmic, horrid, little dark-skinned vamp—and
she lisps—all the time except when she forgets it
or when there aren’t any men around. It’s not nice
for me to talk like this. Probably she’s all right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>only she isn’t good for Nels. I know that. What
I’m afraid of is that she’ll use him. Lots of girls
do, you know, use men like that. She’ll ask his advice
about things and before he knows it he’ll be
painting her old mural for her and she’ll sign it, and
he’ll sit back and let her get the credit for doing it.
It’s been done before, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nels is too sensible for that. He’ll wake up
before it’s gone that far.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so; she <i>is</i> attractive to men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They fell silent for a short space, looking out at
the grey December streets on which no snow had yet
fallen. Now a thin, cold rain began falling, making
the pavements glisten, and giving even well-dressed
pedestrians a shabby appearance as they hurried up
and down—a thick stream of holiday shoppers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My room isn’t much, but at least I live on
Washington Square and that is something,” said
Dorothy. “I love it all the year round, even now
when there aren’t any leaves on the trees or any
Italian children playing and when this beastly rain
falls. I rather like rain anyway, but I’m awfully
glad we’ve got the roses. We’ll get off here and
walk around to the ‘delly’ first. It’s on Bleecker
Street. I’m not supposed to cook anything in my
room, but of course I do. All of us do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their purchases, though guided by the practical
Dorothy, were rather like a college girl’s spread.
Dorothy lived in an old-fashioned white house on
the south side of the square—a house in which every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>piece of decrepit furniture seemed to have been
dragged from its individual attic and assembled here
in vast inharmony. Yet mingled with the 1830
atrocities were a few “good” things, left from time
to time by artists and writers whom prosperity had
called to better quarters. Dorothy lived at the top
of the house in one of the two rooms facing the
square.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see it isn’t really a studio,” she explained
apologetically. “But it has got north light and
the sloping room and that bit of skylight makes it
quite satisfactory, and then, too, I face the Square
and can always see the fountain and the Washington
arch and the first green that comes on the trees in
May, and I like it. And just because we’re celebrating
I’ll put a charcoal fire in the grate and we’ll
make tea in the samovar, but first we must take care
of the flowers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a few minutes she seemed to have forgotten
all her troubles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do wish I had a pretty vase. It’s almost criminal
to put roses in this old jug. Don’t you think the
samovar’s pretty? Nels did get me that. Wait a
minute; I’ll show you his studio. It’s the next room
to this and just like it. He never locks his door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stepped out, Ruth following, and pushed open
the only half closed door of a room, the exact
counterpart in size of her own, but rather more
comfortable as to furnishings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s her picture; she must have given it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>him last week. I haven’t been in his studio for days
and we used to have such corking times together—I
worked here more often than in my own room and
he always seemed to like having me—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fearing a return of tears Ruth hastily retreated
to Dorothy’s room. Besides she didn’t feel quite
comfortable about entering a man’s room during
his absence and examining his pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s not think about her; it’s just a phase and
he’ll recover and come back to you,” she comforted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You make the tea and I’ll spread this little
table,” she continued, removing a pile of sketches
to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short space of time there was a real fire burning
in the tiny grate, throwing a ruddy glow on the
burnished brass of the samovar; in the small room
the roses shed a heavy sweet perfume and the two
girls chatted cosily over their tea cups. Dorothy
smoked a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cigarettes are a party to me,” she exclaimed.
“If I could afford to smoke I might not care for it
at all, but I can’t, so when I want to be extravagant
I smoke; it’s just a symbol.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that Dorothy seemed to have put her grief
into the background Ruth was beginning to feel
restless. On the following day the party was to
leave for the Christmas party. They would arrive
at their destination on the twenty-third of December
and the imminence of the solution of all Ruth’s
worries, for either good or evil, made her feel that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>she should be at the house as much as possible.
Could she have done so she would have followed
Gloria wherever she went. Most of all she wanted
to find out where Professor Pendragon was stopping;
and she ought to telephone Terry again to
remind him not to forget the revolver. In her own
mind she was not exactly sure what she would do
with the gun when she got it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll have to run along,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, and we were having such a good time. I
was beginning to be quite cheered up. Wait a
minute; that’s him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Regardless of grammar, Ruth knew that the masculine
pronoun could refer to only one person.
Down three flights of stairs she could hear a tuneless
but valiant whistle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder why he’s coming home so soon?” continued
Dorothy. “I’ll shut the door tight so he
won’t see us. I’m not going to make it easy for
him to come back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She closed the door as she spoke and the two girls
waited, trying to keep up a hum of conversation.
Dorothy’s agitation communicated itself to Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will he come here?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know; he always did before, but now,
he may just be coming in to get something and
then dash out again to meet her.” She walked to
the window and looked out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s no one down there waiting for him.”
She came back to her place at the tiny table.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>The whistle had mounted all three flights now,
and paused a moment before their door. Dorothy
began talking unconcernedly. They heard him enter
his own studio. The whistle was resumed and they
could hear him moving restlessly about. A match
was struck, then another; then silence, then footsteps
and a knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come in,” called Dorothy, and the door opened,
disclosing a rather shame-faced Nels, who, however,
was determined to appear as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Looks like a party,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a party,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope I’m not intruding—I thought Dorothy
was alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were chattering continuously enough for
any one to hear us,” said Dorothy. “Would you
like a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks—I suppose that means, too, that I can
come in and sit down and share your gossip, and
everything,” said Nels, seating himself forthwith
on the couch-bed—not a chaise longue—but an ugly
bed disguised as a couch—without which no cheap
studio or hall bedroom is complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much is written about the “feminine touch”
which makes home of the most ordinary surroundings.
Ruth thought of it as she looked at Dorothy’s
room. Perhaps, she decided, artistic women are an
exception to this rule. Dorothy had knowledge of
beautiful things, more knowledge than the average
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>woman, but no one would have guessed it from the
untidy shabbiness of her studio. Only the bright
samovar and the roses, thrown into relief by the
firelight, which with the same magic threw dusty
corners into shadow and seemed to gild the ugly,
broken-down furniture into beauty, threw a glamour
over the place now and made it seem quite different
from the cheerless room they had entered over an
hour before. The rain was bringing a premature
twilight which made the firelight doubly welcome.
Nels felt the change and looked about him as if in
unfamiliar surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is certainly cheery,” he said, taking the
cup Dorothy offered him. “And roses!” He looked
inquiringly at Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’m not the lucky girl; some admirer of
Dorothy’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an embarrassed pause. Ruth blushed
because she had told what in childhood she had
called a “white lie”; Dorothy because she accepted
the deception that she would not herself have instigated,
and Nels for many reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoever he is he’s not a poor artist,” he said.
“I know the price of roses in December,” whereupon
he blushed more redly in remembrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you were going to spend the entire
day at the Metropolitan,” said Dorothy, beginning
to enjoy the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So did I,” said Nels, and then with a sudden
burst of resolution, “I don’t mind telling you all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>about it—I’ve been an awful fool, and if you’ve decided
to play with some one else, I don’t blame you.
We walked to the Met this morning; Alice lives way
uptown and I thought it would be a pleasant hike,
but when we got there she was quite worn out, and
then some fellow she knows came along with a car
and offered to take her home and she went; said
the walk had made her too tired to work. Of course
he offered to ‘pick me up,’ too, but I preferred to
walk and I did—all the way from the Metropolitan
to Washington Square—now you know the entire
story and can laugh to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But neither of the girls laughed. Nels had evidently
learned his lesson, and they were in no mood
to increase his discomfiture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to see you to ask if you know where
Professor Pendragon went when he left town. He
said some place in the country, but I’ve forgotten
where,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I got a note from him only this morning.
He’s visiting a friend of his in the Berkshires. North
Adams is the post-office and I’ve forgotten the name
of the house. One of those big country places with
a fancy name—wait and I’ll get the note from my
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He believed that about the roses and now that
he’s sane again, my conscience hurts,” whispered
Dorothy when he had left them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let it hurt a bit; I wouldn’t tell him,” whispered
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Here it is,” said Nels, returning. “Professor
Percival Pendragon, care of Mr. John Peyton-Russell,
Fir Tree Farm, North Adams, Massachusetts—some
address, but anyway it will reach him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Peyton-Russell—he’s at the Peyton-Russell’s?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is, I know Mrs. Peyton-Russell a bit;
she’s a friend of my aunt’s, and we’re going there
for Christmas—going tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really; that’s splendid, for you can save me
writing a note. I hate writing letters. You see
Pendragon has been trying to interest this Peyton-Russell
in my work. He’s one of these men who’s
spent two-thirds of a lifetime making money, and
now he doesn’t know exactly what to do with it.
He’s only been married about two years. I know
Pendragon hadn’t met his wife, but Mr. Peyton-Russell
depends on Pendragon to tell him when
things are good, and when Professor Pendragon
bought one of my pictures Mr. Peyton-Russell
thought he ought to buy one, too. If you’d just
tell Professor Pendragon that I don’t care what he
pays for the picture he has—I let him borrow one to
see whether he grew tired of it after it was hung—you’ll
save me a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course; did you say Professor Pendragon
hasn’t met Mrs. Peyton-Russell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He hadn’t; but I suppose he has now that he’s
a guest in her house. John Peyton-Russell used to
try to get him out to dinner in town, but Pen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>wouldn’t go; he hates society. But he was ill, you
know, and Peyton-Russell was so anxious to do
something for him, and promised that it would be
quiet—no one out there, and the doctor seemed to
think it might be good—he took the nurse along, of
course, so Pen went.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he say how he was getting on, in his last
letter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; just the same, no better and no worse, but
didn’t say anything about coming back at once.
You’re more interested than Dot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; only it seems strange, a coincidence, his
being at the same house we’re going to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“While you’re delivering messages for Nels, deliver
one for me too, Ruth,” said Dorothy. “Tell
him I’m waiting very patiently to make that portrait
and that when it’s finished if he wants to sell
it to his rich collectors he can. What is he, Nels, a
sort of dealer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My word, no—he’s a—just a man who happens
to have a little money and a lot of appreciation.
He’s just helping me to success, and helping Peyton-Russell
to a reputation as a collector—he is quite
disinterested. He could be anything, that man. I
don’t know why he isn’t. Something went wrong
some place along his route, I guess, and he just got
side-tracked, you understand.” He finished with a
wave of his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I really must go—one must do a few
things even before a short journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Ruth was more anxious than ever to get away
now, and neither Nels nor Dorothy made any great
effort to keep her. Nels was looking at the roses
with sad eyes and Dorothy was looking at him with
eyes that made Ruth fear that the secret of the
flowers would not be kept long. Dorothy was too
generous and honest to want to keep up even so tiny
a deception.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one stupendous fact that stood out in her
brain as she walked homeward was that Gloria and
Professor Pendragon would meet. What would
they do? Would Pendragon leave or would Gloria
come back to town? What would they say to each
other? How amazing that Mr. Peyton-Russell
should be a friend of Pendragon’s and that Angela
should be a friend of Gloria’s and that they had
never before all met. Still it was understandable.
Angela had only been married a year. George
would be there, too, and Prince Aglipogue.</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought of Pendragon’s tall, clean-cut figure
and fine face, and of Aglipogue’s heavy countenance
and elephantine form—the contrast. Surely Gloria
would see and withdraw before too late. It would
be, too, the time of test—the dark of the moon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>It had been planned that they would all take the
morning train together for North Adams,
Gloria and Ruth, Terry and Prince Aglipogue
and George, but Gloria, despite her motion picture
experience, proved unequal to the early rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no use,” she explained to Ruth, who went
to her room to wake her. “I simply can’t get up
this early in the morning. You go on and meet
Aggie and Terry at the station and tell them that
I’m coming up on the sleeper tonight. Tell George
to go along, too, just as he planned. He’s got his
ticket and will take care of your luggage and the
others’, and everything will go just as we planned
it except that I’ll show up tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose there isn’t any sleeping train?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be; anyway as far as Pittsfield. Do
go down and tell George and explain to Angela
when you get there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What the trip would have been had Gloria not
decided to wait for the night train, Ruth could not
guess. What it was was most unexpected. George,
being first told, was the first person to show sulky
displeasure at Gloria’s decision. For a moment
Ruth thought that he was actually going to knock
on Gloria’s door and remonstrate with her, but even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>George dared not do that, so instead he preceded
Ruth to the station, heavily laden with boxes and
bags. He was there when she arrived, as was also
Terry, who laughed without any apparent regret at
Gloria’s revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather hated to get up myself,” he said, “but
a holiday is a holiday, and it’s part of the game to
climb out of bed from one to ten hours earlier than
usual. Besides, think how tired we’ll be tonight
and what wonderful sleep we’ll get up there in the
fresh air. There’ll be lots of snow, too. A few
flakes fell here this morning, and that means that up
in the mountains it will be thick and wonderful. I
only hope it won’t be too cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here comes Prince Aglipogue,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Prince was approaching, his great bulk
thrusting aside the lesser human atoms in the station.
Ruth was amazed to see that his curious travelling
costume was finished by a top hat and wondered
whether he would wear it in the train and in the
sleigh from North Adams. Over the collar of his
fur-lined overcoat his huge face rose, placid and self-satisfied,
until he spied the waiting group with Gloria
not among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has she not yet come?” he asked. “The time
of the train is immediate; we will miss it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria has decided to take the evening train,”
said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I also will wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, she especially asked that we all go ahead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>just as planned. Here’s George to take care of
everything,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did she send to me no personal message?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; just that,” Ruth took pleasure in watching
his face, like a cloud-flecked moon, in its annoyance.
“We were all to go ahead and explain to Mrs. Peyton-Russell
that Gloria will arrive in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then the gate was opened and Prince Aglipogue,
still frowning, followed them reluctantly
through it, in front of George and the two porters,
who were helping him carry travelling bags.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were all comfortably disposed in their
seats Ruth began to fear that it would be rather an
unpleasant journey, for Prince Aglipogue, unhappy
himself, was determined that the others should be,
too, if he could make them so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only the amused light in Terry’s eyes gave her
courage. Prince Aglipogue began with a monologue
about rotten trains, stupid country houses, beastly
cold and the improbability of Gloria’s coming at all,
and finally worked himself up into a state of agitation
bordering on tears, which would have made
Ruth laugh had she not been afraid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is unkind of her to leave us this way. For
herself she sleeps comfortably at home, while I rise
at this unchristian hour for her sake,” he protested,
more to himself than to the others, for he seemed
determined to ignore them. His next phase was one
of annoyance at his own discomfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Why had not the Peyton-Russells themselves provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>a drawing-room for him? They were
“filthy” with money, and he was not accustomed to
travelling in this public manner in spite of the fact
that he was only a poor artist. Then he became
worried about his luggage, which had consisted of
a single dressing-case. He had entrusted it to
George, and who knew what had become of it? He
lurched off in search of George some place in the
rear cars to find out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d buy him a drawing-room just to get rid of
him, if there was any graceful way of doing it,” said
Terry. “I’m afraid this is not going to be the
pleasantest of parties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For more reasons than one,” said Ruth. “I
discovered yesterday that Professor Pendragon is
already a guest of the Peyton-Russells. What will
happen when Gloria arrives and they meet? Ought
I to tell him, do you think, that she’s coming?” She
had been thinking of nothing else since her talk with
Nels and was delighted to have an opportunity to
tell some one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is going to be fun! How do you know,
and why do you suppose Angela Peyton-Russell is
doing it—some idea of bringing them together
again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see any fun in it with that beast Aglipogue
along. And Angela didn’t know—at least,
I’m quite sure she didn’t, and doesn’t. Professor
Pendragon is a friend of Mr. Peyton-Russell and
had never met his wife, and I don’t think Angela
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>was going to the house many days before her guests.
Mr. Peyton-Russell asked Professor Pendragon
there because they’re old friends and Pendragon was
ill. He thought the air and quiet would be good
for him. He took a nurse along. I only learned
yesterday from Nels Zord. Unless Angela has
mentioned the names of all her guests, it’s possible
that Professor Pendragon doesn’t know she’s coming.
It’s going to be awfully awkward—meeting
that way. I suppose one of them will return to New
York. Perhaps he would if we warned him. Do
you think I ought?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You didn’t warn Gloria, and you had time for
that; I don’t see why you should warn her ex-husband.
Besides, it isn’t such an awful thing. Ex-husbands
and wives meet every day in New York
and don’t seem to mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a way I suppose I didn’t tell Gloria because
she told me not to mention his name again, and besides
I’d like to have her meet him, providing she
didn’t make a scene. If she saw him again I don’t
think she could go on with the Prince.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think she really is going to marry him?”
asked Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course she is, unless you or some one stops
her; I don’t see how you can stand by quietly and
see it done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no affair—here he comes now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their conversation, thus broken off by the reappearance
of Prince Aglipogue, they turned to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>scenery outside, while their heavy companion, turning
his back upon them as much as possible, pretended
to read a magazine. The snow that had
been falling in thin flakes in New York was coming
down in great, feathery “blobs,” as Terry descriptively
called them. At first they did not see any
hills, but the movement of the train and the stertorous
puffing of the engine told them that they were
going steadily upgrade. Now the ground was
entirely covered with snow, and the train twisted so
continuously around the hills that sometimes they
could see the engine curving in front of them,
through the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the snow continues like this, I’m afraid we’ll
be many hours late,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t matter much. We’re to be there at
two o’clock, and we couldn’t be delayed more than
a few hours at most, could we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are pleased to be cheerful,” said the Prince.
Evidently he had not been so deeply engaged with
his magazine as he pretended. “If I am forced on
this train to remain a moment longer than is necessary
I shall perish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They do get snow bound, sometimes, you
know,” said Terry cheerfully. “It won’t be so
bad if we’re near some town. We can just get off
and spend the night in an hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this the Prince only glared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would be an adventure—I think I’d rather
like it,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>As if he could bear no more the Prince again
departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Presently he’ll come back, saying that the air
in the smoking car has made his head ache.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you want to go yourself for a smoke?
You know you mustn’t think you have to stay here
and amuse me,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can live ever so long without a cigarette.
Besides I’d rather go when he isn’t there. I’ve been
thinking about Gloria. Do you suppose she could
have found out about Pendragon and isn’t coming?
It would be like her. She could telephone that she’s
ill or something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so, but of course I don’t know. I
don’t know anything. Perhaps Pendragon himself
has left and all my worry is for nothing. Who’d
ever think an aunt could be such a responsibility?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She said it so seriously and with such a wistful
look that Terry restrained his impulse to laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An aunt is almost as difficult to chaperon as a
modern mother,” he admitted gravely; “but if the
snow doesn’t stop snowing she may arrive as soon
as we do, and you’ll not have to decide whether to
warn the professor or not. After all, it’s no affair
of yours. If they’re to meet this way they will meet
this way, and it may be rather amusing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was difficult to answer him when he talked
like that. Probably his words were prompted by
bitterness, but it was maddening to have him sit
back as if he were helpless to do anything. If only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>he would make an effort he could win Gloria away
from her present course. He was attractive enough
to win any woman. Whether he talked or sat silent,
it was good to be with him. Then she remembered
the gift he had promised her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’ve forgotten! I was afraid you
would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I haven’t. You mean the revolver, but I
thought it was to be a Christmas gift.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was—only I’d like to have it now if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you afraid of—train robbers? This
isn’t a western movie in spite of the wild nature
of our journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know, but please let me have it. You don’t
know what a comfort it would be just to look at it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right; just to show you how much I thought
of it I didn’t pack it at all. It’s here in my overcoat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An eager porter anticipated his movement to
reach up to the rack on which the coat had been put,
and brought it down for him, and he reached inside
the pocket and brought out a box which he put in
her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment she did not open it, though he
waited, smiling. She was conscious of the movement
of the train, of the white flakes flashing past
the window, half obscuring the rolling, tree-crowned
hills that were fast merging into mountains; of the
smell of the Pullman car,—a combination of steam-heated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>varnish and dusty upholstery—and most of
all of Terry, seated opposite her, a half eager, half
amused light dancing in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s rather an odd gift to give a woman,” he
said as she hesitated. She opened the box now,
realizing herself more than anything else, as the
central figure in a little drama. Inside she found
a leather case—pale blue leather, more fit to contain
jewels than a weapon of defence, and inside that the
tiniest revolver she had ever seen, an exquisite thing
with gold mountings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will—will it really shoot?” she gasped. “And
it must have been horribly expensive—you shouldn’t
have done it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her pleasure was so apparent in her face that
her words, which she felt were ill chosen, did not
really matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it will shoot; and it’s loaded now, so
please do be careful. Here, I’ll show you how it
works—see, you open it this way, and here’s the
way to empty the shells out—you see there are six—this
revolves so that when you’ve shot one the
next one moves into place all ready; it’s quite as
deadly as a big one, I assure you. Do you think
you’ll feel quite safe with this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t myself I want to protect,” she answered,
and just then, she saw Prince Aglipogue returning,
and some instinct prompted her to take the gun
from his hands and put it back in its case and conceal
it behind her. She need not have concealed it, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Prince Aglipogue was in no mood to observe details.
His oily, black eyes were standing out in his
head and his face had turned a sickly green. His
three chins seemed to be trembling with fright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That nigger of Gloria’s; he’s in the baggage
car with a snake—a snake as big as”—he threw out
his fat arms as if he could think of no word to
describe the size of the snake. His voice was a
thin whisper. “You must the conductor tell—it is
not allowed. They do not know the trunk’s contents—I
tell you I am speaking truth—a snake—as
big as the engine—will you do nothing?” He
grasped Terry’s shoulder and shook him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right. We know all about it. Miss
Mayfield knew he was bringing it. He uses it in
his vaudeville stunts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you I will not go on—to travel with a
snake—it is horrible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s always had it,” soothed Terry. “It was
in the house on Gramercy Square and never came out
and bit any one. I guess you’re safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I had known——” He shuddered through
all his fat frame and rolled his eyes upward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is he taking it?” asked Terry. “It’s bad
enough to travel with a pet dog, but what one does
with a pet snake I don’t know, and I’ve been
curious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Aglipogue, frightened into friendliness,
broke into a torrent of words from which they gathered
that George had the snake in a trunk, the sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of which were warmed by electricity; that the train
officials had no idea of the contents of the trunk,
that George had gained access to the baggage car
though it was against the rules, and that the Prince,
being still worried about his luggage, though he had
seen it safely aboard, had claimed the right to follow
him there and had found George kneeling beside the
opened trunk, from which the snake, artificially
warmed to activity, was rearing a head which the
Prince protested was as large as that of a cow. As
he saw that his hearers were unmoved and that they
had known about the snake and seemed to consider
it quite ordinary, he was a bit ashamed of his agitation,
though by no means convinced that there was
no cause for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a harmless variety,” Terry assured him. “If
it were dangerous Gloria wouldn’t have allowed
George to keep it in the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the bite, yes; it may be of no harm, but the
shock to the nerves! I should have been warned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t know that you were going into the
baggage car,” protested Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a terrible journey—look at the snow,”
said the Prince, sinking into his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>They looked out. The movement of the train
exaggerated the whirling of the snow until it seemed
like a frozen, white whirlwind, sweeping past them,
or a drove of wild, white horses whose manes
brushed the window panes. Beyond the whirling
drift they could see nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Terry looked at his watch. Down the aisle Ruth
heard a man asking how late they were, but could
not catch the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s have something to eat; even if we’re on
time, we won’t want to wait luncheon until our arrival.
A twelve-mile drive through this doesn’t
sound very alluring, and we may die of starvation
on the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry’s glance included both Ruth and Prince
Aglipogue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Food I cannot face after what I have witnessed,”
said the Prince. “Perhaps I may have
something—a cup of tea—something to keep up my—what
did you say—two hours late?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He clutched the arm of a passing conductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; two hours late now—only two hours,”
he answered wearily, freeing his arm and passing on.
Prince Aglipogue sank back in his chair as if he
would never rise again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cheer up; that’s not bad. What can you expect
with this snow? Two hours only means that we’ll
arrive about five o’clock and get to Fir Tree Lodge—I
think that’s what they call it—in time for dinner.
Better come on and eat with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Prince Aglipogue shook his huge head sadly,
much to the relief of both Terry and Ruth, and they
walked out together. Ruth was beginning to feel
that she was having an adventure. Something in
the restlessness of the other passengers on the train,
who were beginning to look frequently at watches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and to stop the train officials every time they appeared,
something in the sight of the whirling clouds
of snow, the thought of George, some place back
there with his strange travelling companion, all contributed
to the undercurrent of excitement, and with
it was that comforting feeling of security that always
comes from looking at storm and snow from a place
of warmth and shelter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because it was the holiday season the train was
crowded and they were compelled to wait in the
narrow hallway with other people in line before
they could get a table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t it wonderful and Christmasy?” she
asked, “especially as I’ve already got one gift; see,
I brought it with me. I’d like to look at it again,
only I’m afraid if any of the other passengers saw
it they might suspect me of being a train robber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; you look so much like one. But perhaps
it would be just as well not to look at it now. I’m
glad you like it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s beautiful, and somehow I feel safer—I
mean safer and happier about Gloria now that I
have it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a curious gift to give a girl, but I couldn’t
exactly imagine giving you—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Table for two,” interrupted the steward. Ruth
wondered what it was that Terry couldn’t imagine
giving her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Luncheon was like a party. Terry seemed to be
making as much effort to amuse her as he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>have made for Gloria, or perhaps he was so charming
that he couldn’t help being charming all the time,
she reflected. He had the most wonderful eyes in
the world, and the kindest, strongest mouth, but she
must stop looking at them. Still just for today she
might pretend that he was her lover and that they
were engaged, and—why not pretend that they were
actually married and on their wedding journey?
The thought made her gasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is something wrong? I’ll call the waiter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, nothing! I was just thinking—of something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something nice, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, no—I don’t know.” It was horrible to
blush like that. If she were only older and poised
and sophisticated. Perhaps then she wouldn’t have
to be pretending. But she would pretend, no matter
how bold and unladylike it was to pretend such
things and perhaps she would never be with him
again in just this way, and it would be nice to
remember.</p>

<p class='c007'>In her reckless mood she surprised herself by saying
things like Gloria sometimes. They lingered as
long as they dared because it was such a good way
of killing time, and when they had finished she made
Terry go back to the smoker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They ought to have smoking cars for women,”
she said. It was what Gloria might have said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you don’t smoke,” said Terry, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know, but I shall learn.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Not right away, I hope,” he said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth found that Prince Aglipogue had controlled
his nervous shock to the extent of having a very substantial
lunch brought to him, which he seemed to be
enjoying as much as if snakes had never been
created, but he showed no more disposition to be
sociable than before, for which Ruth was grateful.
It would have spoiled her illusion that she and Terry
were travelling alone together. Even she did not
think he was gone long. He came back looking
rather sober.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you be very much frightened if we didn’t
reach North Adams tonight at all?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not frightened; but why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks as though we couldn’t go much farther.
We may have to stop. You can see how slowly
we’re moving now. If they can get to the next
station we can all stop at an hotel, but if not we
may have to sit up all night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it’ll be rather fun—only won’t Angela
Peyton-Russell be worried?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’ll probably have telephoned the station at
North Adams and will know that we’re late. Gloria
was wise. The track may be clear by the time her
train leaves and she’ll arrive as soon as we.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I won’t have to decide about warning Professor
Pendragon. He’ll learn the news less gently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He may have left,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know whether to wish that he has or
has not,” said Ruth. She could not bear the thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of Gloria’s marrying Prince Aglipogue, but every
hour it seemed to grow more difficult to entertain
the thought of her marrying Terry. Of course it
wasn’t absolutely necessary for her to marry any
one, but she must be in a marrying mood, or she
wouldn’t think of Aglipogue, and she’d done it so
often before that it ought to be easier every time.
If only she could ask Terry what he thought, but
of course she couldn’t do that.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Aglipogue had heard Terry’s first words
and had lumbered off to secure the first-hand information.
All the other men in the coach seemed
to be doing the same thing. The snow had brought
on a premature darkness and the lights were lit so
that now they could see nothing outside. One could
almost feel the struggles of the engine, which seemed
to grow greater and greater as the speed of the train
grew less. Finally it stopped altogether with a
sound of grinding wheels. The conductor told them
not to be alarmed. It was nothing but a few hours’
delay. A steam plough was already on its way. It
was impossible to say how long.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a few minutes the passengers all talked to
each other. Some of the men thought that if they
could reach the road they might hail a passing sleigh
that might convey some of them to the nearest town,
but the road was half a mile away and there would
be few vehicles abroad in such a storm, and the idea
was abandoned. Terry went back to see how
George was faring, and reported him still in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>baggage car, sleeping on the trunk which doubtless
contained “the daughter of Shiva.”</p>

<p class='c007'>People settled down to waiting; some of them
read, and others slept, among them Prince Aglipogue.
He snored unrebuked. Ruth heard a man
inviting Terry to a poker game in the smoking car
and was relieved when he refused. It would have
been lonely without him. She tried to read, but the
car was growing steadily colder. Terry insisted that
she put on her cloak, but even that didn’t help much,
when she was stiff with inaction. She tried to read,
and finally curled up in the chair to sleep. Her last
conscious thought was a protest when she felt rather
than saw Terry wrapping his cloak around her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth awakened to the sound of grinding
brakes and opened her eyes to look into the
eyes of Terry, which seemed very near as he
bent over her. Her muscles were horribly cramped.
She did not fully remember until he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll be on our way in less than an hour, and
if you want some coffee you’d better hurry. The
train was only prepared for one meal, but there is
some coffee and perhaps a piece of toast, if we get
there before the hungry mob has finished it,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You gave me your coat,” she said, looking down
at the garment that was wrapped about her. “You
shouldn’t have done that; I had my own, and you
must have frozen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all; I’ve slept beautifully. Did it keep
you warm?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all that counts; come on and get some
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t I even wait to wash my face, or shall I
wash it afterward, cat fashion?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it’s really necessary, you may; but you look
remarkably clean and fresh considering—a few
grains of dust, perhaps—”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>He looked at her with his head on one side,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was on her feet in an instant, but discovering
that one foot was asleep, did not make such swift
progress as she had expected. There were two
other women in the dressing-room. Yesterday they
would have looked at her as silently and impersonally
as at the mirror or the wash basin or the black
“prop” comb that is always found in Pullman
dressing-rooms and that no one has ever been known
to use, but now they were talking to her and to each
other. The stout lady who was going home from a
day’s Christmas shopping in New York was most
voluble. She was worried about her husband and
children, especially her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I’ll ever say to Henry, I don’t know. He
told me that I could do just as well in Pittsfield as
in New York. They have everything there, and
such accommodating sales people—not like New
York, where every one is too busy to be polite—and
I didn’t get a thing I went after—and then this horrible
experience. It’s added ten years to my life—I
know it has.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After all, it was only a delay,” comforted Ruth.
“Suppose the train had been wrecked. I think it
was rather fun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fun! Fun!” the tall thin woman fairly
shrieked at her, and the eyebrow pencil she was
using slipped and made a long mark down her nose
that she had to rub off subsequently with cold cream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>producing a fine, high polish, which in turn had to
be removed with powder, so thickly applied that
Ruth thought she looked as if her nose was made of
plaster of Paris and had been fastened on after the
rest of her face was finished. It was difficult to do
anything in the tiny crowded space, but she finally
completed a hasty toilet and hurried out to rejoin
Terry, who, in her absence, had secured two cups of
coffee and some toast and brought them to their
seats in the Pullman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s the Prince?” she asked suddenly, remembering
his unwelcome existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the dining-car; he got there early and
managed to secure what little food there was
aboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria’s train is right behind us,” he continued,
“so we’ll wait for her at the station and all go up
together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The increasing warmth in the train was beginning
to clear the frosted windows, and Ruth could see
that the snow had stopped falling. A wonderful
pink glow was resting on top of the softly rounded
mountains, and where the clouds were herded between
two high crests it looked like a rose-coloured
lake with fir trees on its banks. She forgot her
uncomfortable night and felt new-born like the sun.
Everything was simple and easy. Everything would
be solved; Gloria would not marry Prince Aglipogue.
She certainly would not, for he came in
now, unshaved, with bloodshot eyes and rumpled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>linen. He did not speak at all, but slumped in
his chair, his chins resting on his bulging shirt
bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you seen George?” she asked Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he’s all right. I only hope the daughter
of Shiva froze to death, but I fear not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will it be long now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll be into North Adams in less than an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid you didn’t get any sleep at all,” said
Ruth, observing that his eyes looked tired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I look as badly as that?” he parried.
“Never mind, wait until we reach Fir Tree Farm
and I’ve had a mug of hot Scotch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s hot Scotch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s something that no one would think of drinking
at any time except the Christmas holiday—and
the only thing that it seems quite correct to drink on
a Christmas holiday, especially in a country house.
It’s hot, and sweet and full of Captain Kidd’s own
brand of rum, and spice, and—oh, ever so many
things. You’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps Gloria won’t let me drink it,” said
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ask her—from now on you must ask me—and
if I say you may, it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t I tucked you in and watched over you
like a mother?” said Terry. “That gives me the
right to say yes and no about things. I shall explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>my new position just as soon as the stately Gloria
steps off the train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is North Adams; I heard a man say
so—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; we’re here. I wonder if there’s food in
the station. I’m starving already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not food at the station, but there was
a huge sleigh drawn by two powerful horses, with
bells on their harness that tinkled merrily in the
sharp air, and a man from Fir Tree Farm. Inquiry
revealed the fact that Gloria’s train would be in
within fifteen minutes and Terry told the man to
wait. Meantime George appeared, looking as calm
and imperturbable as if he had just stepped out of
the house on Gramercy Square. They all sat on
hard benches in the railway station, or looking
through the soiled windows at other passengers driving
gaily off to their homes—and breakfast, as Terry
said quite wistfully. Prince Aglipogue paced up
and down in melancholy silence. Ruth could imagine
that he was preparing dignified reproaches to hurl
at the auburn head of Gloria. Her train came in
finally and she stepped off swathed in furs, exhaling
the perfume of violets, followed by respectful
porters and greeted by George, who took possession
of everything, before the vicarious servitors quite
knew what was happening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria looked so fresh and beautiful, so perfectly
groomed and so rested, that they all felt shabbier
than ever and more dishevelled. They made a rush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>for her, and when George had stepped aside she
greeted them with bright smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, people. You see I was right! What a
wonderful morning! Hello, Aggie—you look as if
you’d been in a wreck, and Ruth and Terry as if
they’d been, oh, on an adventure. I actually believe
you liked it. What did you sleep on?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been a terrible experience,” Prince Aglipogue
began, trying to look reproachful, but only
succeeding in looking ridiculous. He could get no
further in his speech, for Ruth and Terry were both
talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We did enjoy it; wish you’d been along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We slept in our chairs, at least I did, but I don’t
believe Terry slept at all. You look gorgeous,
Gloria—there’s a sleigh out there with bells on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, then; I’m famished. Didn’t you get
up in time for breakfast even if there’d been any to
get? Have you eaten?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; only a cup of coffee—very bad, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They followed George, all talking at once, and
piled into the sleigh. There was straw on the bottom
and many fur robes, the heaviest of which Aglipogue
managed to collect for himself and Gloria,
who were in the back of the sleigh. Ruth would
have loved to sit in front with the driver, but, of
course, George had to sit there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My word, why did you wear that?” Gloria
burst into peals of laughter, and lifted the silk hat
from the head of Prince Aglipogue.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“Naturally I supposed that the millionaires, your
friends, would send a conveyance suitable—an enclosed
car. How was I to know—straw, farm
horses?” He almost snorted in his disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re so funny, Aggie! Don’t you know there
isn’t a motor built that could drive through these
mountains in winter time? We’re lucky that the
sleigh can make it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth noted with horror that in her laughter there
was a tender note as if she were talking to an attractive,
big boy. Instinctively she turned to look
at George’s straight back, and long, narrow head.
It seemed to her that his ears were visibly listening.</p>

<p class='c007'>From somewhere Terry produced a long, knitted
scarf, and this Gloria tied around the Prince’s head,
laying his hat tenderly down in the middle of the
sleigh. He looked like a huge, ugly boy with mumps,
Ruth thought, and Gloria, whose sense of humour
even her Titania-like love could not quite quench,
burst into renewed peals of laughter. Perhaps he’ll
get angry and break his engagement, Ruth thought,
hopefully, but his resentment seemed to be at things
in general rather than at Gloria.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were really very comfortable in spite of
the keen wind and the country round them was
magnificent, hill melting into hill in endless procession
like the waves on a limitless ocean. The sky
was a vivid blue and the rich green of the fir and
hemlock trees shone warm in contrast to the white
snow. The clear ringing of the bells on the horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>seemed like fairy music leading them over the hills
and far away to some tremendous adventure. Just
what that adventure would be Ruth could not guess,
but she knew that Gloria would be its heroine and
George the villain. As for Prince Aglipogue, with
his fat face swathed in the scarf, she would concede
him no other rôle than that of buffoon. The hero?
Perhaps Professor Pendragon, perhaps Terry, but
she would rather save Terry for another story.</p>

<p class='c007'>If only she knew whether Professor Pendragon
was still at Fir Tree Lodge. It would have been
easy to ask the driver, who was an inquisitive New
Englander and was making desperate attempts to
talk with George, but, of course, she dared not do
that because of Gloria. After all she was not supposed
to know anything about the guests. That was
Angela Peyton-Russell’s affair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heavy snow rather helped than impeded their
progress, but they were all rather cold and tremendously
hungry before they reached the gates of Fir
Tree Farm. Then there was a slow pull up to the
top of the hill on which it was built, a huge stone
house, almost hidden in a forest of fir trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Aglipogue shuddered when he looked at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is it heated?” he asked in tragic tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very old-fashioned—no furnace or steam heat—just
fire places like your dear castles in Europe,”
said Gloria, which was not true, but served its purpose
of making him look even more melancholy and
making Gloria laugh again. She was quite the gayest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>person in the party and didn’t even complain of
hunger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela Peyton-Russell was not at the door to
greet them, but a maidservant and a man servant
were. Angela had read some place that it was not
smart to greet one’s guests in country homes that
way, so she did what she thought was the correct
thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Though she’s probably watching us from some
point of vantage,” Gloria whispered to Ruth, as they
followed the maid up a wide staircase, at the top of
which she separated them, leading Ruth into what
looked like the most cheerful room in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your luggage will be up directly,” she told
Ruth, “and as soon as you can you’re to come down
to breakfast. Mrs. Peyton-Russell has waited it for
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She left at once, evidently going to attendance on
Gloria, who any servant could see at a glance was
the more important guest of the two. While she
was waiting for her bags Ruth warmed herself before
a wonderful wood fire, in front of which a blue
satin-covered day bed tempted her to further rest.
Through the wide windows the tops of the mountains
that had looked so cold when she was driving to the
house resumed the almost warm beauty that she had
admired on the train. Snow always looks thus,
infinitely attractive when one is safely indoors before
a fire, but rather cold and lonely when one is travelling
through it. She had hardly had time to remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>her cloak and hat when a tap at the door announced
her bags, and another maid came in to help her
unpack. Ruth let her stay because she took rather
kindly to being served, an inheritance from her
mother, who came from Virginia, and because she
might, without appearing too curious, learn something
of the other guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are there many people here?” she asked. It
sounded rather unsubtle after she had said it, but
the maid was evidently a country girl, not like the
one who had brought her up, who had probably
come from the Peyton-Russell town house, and
she did not seem surprised, but rather glad to
talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only Mr. and Mrs. Peyton-Russell, and Miss
Mayfield—but you came with her—you’re Miss
Ruth Mayfield? and the foreign prince, and Mr.
Riordan and Professor Pendragon, a poor sick man
who’s been here almost a month, and a Miss Gilchrist,
a singer. Perhaps you know her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t think so,” said Ruth, almost sorry
she had spoken, for the maid seemed to consider it
an invitation to talk at length.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll be surprised when you meet her, Miss;
she’s that odd—not at all like you other ladies. She
sings beautiful—do you want to change for breakfast?
I wouldn’t if I were you. The breakfast’s
waiting—here, let me smooth your hair—no, I want
it for practice—one day I want to be a lady’s maid—a
personal maid.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>She laid great stress on the first syllable of the
word personal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They say some of these personal maids in big
houses gets lovely tips—not that I want tips; I’m
glad to serve some people, but a working girl’s got
to take care of herself. If they was all like Miss
Gilchrist life <i>would</i> be hard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had a curious way of talking, with a rising
and falling inflection, stressing unexpected words and
syllables, so that in listening to her voice Ruth
scarcely heard her words and forgot that she ought
not to encourage servant’s gossip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s terrible homely for one thing, and I think
looking at herself in the mirror has soured her disposition.
She wears her hair short, and at first I
thought it was toifide fever. You should seen her
glare at me when I ast. You better run right down;
I’ll finish unpacking for you. You look too sweet;
clothes ain’t everything.” With which doubtful
compliment ringing in her ears, Ruth passed out, but
instead of “running right down” she knocked at
Gloria’s door. She had the feeling that if they
were to walk down and meet Professor Pendragon
face to face she wanted to be with Gloria. She had
a vague fear that Gloria might faint, and she wanted
to be there to bear her up. Gloria was herself all
ready for descent, but she had changed her travelling
costume for a charming frock. Hunger had doubtless
prompted speed and a theatrical woman’s facility
had aided her. She looked stunning, Ruth thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and her heart swelled with pride at the thought that
at least her Gloria was looking her very best for the
encounter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Afraid to go down alone?” Gloria asked.
“You needn’t be; you’re looking ducky. I hope she
has a millionaire for you to meet, but no such luck.
That would spoil ‘our Bohemian circle.’”. She
mimicked Angela’s gurgling voice perfectly. “I
dare say those hungry brutes of men are waiting
now—if they have the grace to wait, which I doubt;
I could eat almost anything myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela, having done her conventional duty by not
meeting them at the door, now yielded to her emotions
and ran halfway up the stairs to meet them,
hurling herself into Gloria’s arms and even kissing
Ruth on the cheek to make her feel that she was
welcome and really belonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, we’re having breakfast in the sun
parlour; it’s the loveliest room in the house. Every
one is waiting. I’ve only two other guests, and I
didn’t tell them who was coming. You’ll be such a
welcome surprise,” she gurgled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will, indeed,” thought Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the library,” she waved her hand at an
enormous room with gloomy furniture, the door of
which was open. “Cosy little place, don’t you
think? But here—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She paused dramatically before she threw open
the door of the sun parlour. She was after all such
a fluffy, good-hearted child that her pride in her possessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>was no more offensive than the pride of a
child in new toys, and Ruth couldn’t blame her for
being proud of the room they entered. They all
stood at the open door looking at it a moment before
entering—a long, narrow room, evidently running
the full length of the house from north to south, with
two sides of glass, window after window with drawn-back
draperies of amber silk, and between each
window a bird cage, hung above a tall blue vase
filled with cut flowers. At one end of the room the
breakfast table was spread and at the other, where
there were no windows, was a fireplace, round which
the men were standing—Terry, Prince Aglipogue
and John Peyton-Russell. There was a lady seated
there, too, and in another big, wing chair Ruth
thought she could discern the top of Professor Pendragon’s
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had satisfied Angela with their admiration,
and as they came in the three standing men advanced
to meet them, and the woman turned her
head. Ruth looked at her, and her brain working
by a sort of double process, she had time to compare
her with the maid’s description, even while her heart
was standing still because of the imminent meeting
of Gloria and Professor Pendragon. Miss Gilchrist
did have short hair, not a fluffy mass like
Dorothy Winslow’s, but lank, dank, soiled-brown
locks that framed a lank, soiled-brown countenance.
Her gown also seemed to be of a dusty black, and
Ruth could easily imagine that if her manners were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>no more attractive than her appearance, she would
be quite as disagreeable as the maid described her.
A closer view showed an out-thrust foot in a long,
flat, soiled-brown shoe, and Ruth remembered what
Dorothy had once told her:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never trust a woman who wears common sense
shoes—there is something radically wrong with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was being introduced to Mr. Peyton-Russell
now. She had never met him before. He was a
large man who looked as if he took his material
wealth very seriously indeed and thought he owed
some reparation to the public from which he had
extracted it, but he had a heavy cordiality that was
rather charming because it was so obviously sincere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now you must meet the others,” chirped
Angela.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth realized for the first time that Angela was
like a yellow canary. The birds, singing gaily in the
sunshine, made the comparison almost compulsory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to come to them, and anyway, I
always have cocktails in front of the fireplace. After
that lone, cold ride, you must need one, though it is
only ten o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They followed her across the long room, Ruth
walking a step behind Gloria, watching her face,
waiting for the moment when she should see around
the high-backed chair. They must have seen him at
the same moment, for Ruth’s heart gave a little
thump and it seemed that Gloria missed a step, her
body swaying just perceptibly for a second, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>one hand flew to her throat in a gesture that Ruth
had seen before. Her colour did not change, but with
the sophistication of four months in New York Ruth
knew that Gloria’s colour did not “come and go”
for very good reason. The biggest change was in
her eyes. They seemed to have turned a dark violet
and to have opened wider than Ruth had ever seen
them before, in a fixed stare. They were standing
before him now. In her anxiety about Gloria she
had not thought of him at all. His face was quite
white and he seemed to be nerving himself for some
tremendous ordeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me for not rising,”—he indicated the
crutches beside his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Pendragon’s not a bit like a real invalid—one
forgets it the moment one talks to him,”
apologized Angela, rather tactlessly. “He and
John are such good friends that I used to be jealous
of him, and when I heard he was ill I insisted that
John make him come, and do you know, he wanted
to run away before, but I told him what clever people
were coming and made him stay—aren’t you glad
now that you’ve met Gloria Mayfield, and Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Ruth Mayfield and I have met before,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was almost afraid to look at him. There was
in his eyes a look of questioning, almost of reproach.
He had grown thinner and she wondered how Gloria
could be so heartless. Still it wasn’t all Gloria’s
fault. Ruth had seen her dark eyes melt with pity at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>sight of the crutches—pity and a sort of bewildered
fright, but when he spoke as if he had never seen her
before, the soft look faded and her eyes changed
from violet to the coldest grey imaginable, and her
mouth set in a cold line, quite unlike its natural
form.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sure you’ll like our little Bohemian circle,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth wondered how she dared make fun of Angela
that way in her own house. Somehow or other
they had all been presented to Miss Gilchrist, too,
but she proved to be one of those persons one habitually
forgets, and who is perpetually trying to call
back the wandering attention of others, like a friendless
pup rubbing his nose in the hands of strangers,
hoping some place to find a master. Of course Miss
Gilchrist hadn’t that kind of nose, but there was a
pitiful look in her dust-coloured brown eyes that
simply plead for attention. Evidently Terry saw it,
for he was talking to her now, or perhaps he was
only trying to relieve what was an awkward moment
for him as well as for Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cocktails came and though Ruth had never
seen Gloria drink anything stronger than coffee before
four o’clock in the afternoon, she took this one
in the way that Ruth had sometimes seen men drink,
almost pouring it down. They all moved off to the
breakfast table then, Gloria with John Peyton-Russell,
Angela beside Prince Aglipogue, and Terry
with Miss Gilchrist. Ruth waited while Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Pendragon picked up his crutches. Evidently he
could get about very well by himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to see you after breakfast—as soon as
possible,” she whispered to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The enclosed veranda at five o’clock,” he whispered
back.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wanted to ask him what and where the enclosed
veranda was, but there was no chance. Every
one was talking at once, it seemed; that is, every one
except Professor Pendragon and herself. She tried
to catch Terry’s eyes, but when she did, he only
lifted one eyebrow as who should say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, your anxiety was needless; they are
sophisticated New Yorkers and didn’t mind a
bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But they did mind; she knew that. If they
had recognized each other—that would have been
the sophisticated thing to do. Instead they had
taken the romantic course and met as strangers,
though unlike strangers they did not talk to each
other. All around her she could hear snatches of
conversation. Terry seemed to have quite won the
formidable Miss Gilchrist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I sing,” she could hear her saying; “but I
prefer poetry to any of the arts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really?” said Terry politely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I say that poetry is my chief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span>. I
have a poem this month in <cite>Zaneslie’s</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must read it,” murmured Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should hear me recite to really appreciate;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>don’t you think that one is always the best interpreter
of one’s own work?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry nodded understandingly, and then in a voice
that amused Ruth even while she thought it rather
cruel of him to laugh at the serious Miss Gilchrist:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you write rhymed poetry or do you prefer
free verse?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gilchrist deserted her grape fruit and gave
him her undivided attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, Mr. Riordan, for years I have
written rhymed poetry, but recently, quite recently,
I have felt a definite urge toward the free medium.
I have not relinquished the rhyme, but I am expressing
myself in both forms. The free medium—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice went on, and on, but Ruth could not
hear her now because Gloria’s voice, clear and high
like the sleigh bells, rose above everything else for
the moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I can’t work in Terry’s play; I’ve decided
never to go back to the stage. I want to travel—South
America, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re going there on a concert tour, aren’t
you, Prince?” said Angela. “Perhaps—if you
have a secret from me, Gloria, I don’t know what
I shall do to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Ruth’s eyes met those of Professor
Pendragon. She saw a strange light flash
into them, like a sword half withdrawn from its
sheath and then replaced, as he dropped his eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>It was easy to slip away alone. Ruth knew that
Gloria, who had gone to her own room, expected
to be followed, but she did not want to
talk alone with Gloria until she had seen Professor
Pendragon. She found the enclosed veranda, a sleeping
porch above the sun room. She threw a heavy
cloak about her shoulders and passed unobserved
down the hall and through the narrow doorway
leading outside. He was there, waiting for her in
his wheel chair. There was another chair beside
him, perhaps for the nurse. She could look out over
a wide circle of white hills with masses of dark
green where fir trees clustered in the hollows. The
outer edge of the circle was stained a deep rose, so
that hill and cloud lay heaped against the sunset
bathed in cold flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>She moved toward him slowly, wondering how
she would begin now that she had kept her rendezvous.
He laid down the pipe he had been smoking
and held out a hand to her, a hand through which
the light seemed to shine, it was so pale and thin.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat down beside him without speaking at once
and looked for a moment at the sunset hills. They
seemed so quiet and cold and peaceful. What she
was going to say would sound strange and unreal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>here—more strange even than it sounded in New
York.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to talk to you about Gloria,” she began,
but he did not speak when she paused, so she
went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you sent me that card to the water
colour show—it was at breakfast I got it—Gloria
told me that she’d been married to you. She’s my
aunt—my father’s sister, but I’d never seen her until
after father and mother both died and I came here
to study art. Mother sent me to her because she is
my only living relative. She didn’t know you were
in New York until I got that card, and she asked
me not to tell you about her, so I lied when you
asked me about myself, or at least didn’t tell the
truth. Then just before we came here I saw Nels
Zord and he told me you were here too. At first I
thought of telling Gloria, but I didn’t because I want
you to help me. I want you to save Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I can’t save Gloria, my child, any
more than Gloria can save me—she perhaps has lost
her soul—tomorrow I lose my life. It is all set
and we have as little to do with it as with that thin
thread of waning moon up there, which tomorrow
night will be utterly dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But don’t you see, Gloria doesn’t understand
and that’s why she is helpless; but you do understand
and can prevent things. You said yourself to
me once, ‘The stars incline but do not compel.’ If
you won’t help me I must do everything alone, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>you must tell me the truth, isn’t George the cause
of your illness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He leaned suddenly toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You talked about the evil eye and the dark of
the moon; the others, Nels and Dorothy, thought
you were joking or talking in riddles, but I didn’t.
The night of the show, when you were first stricken,
I saw George performing incantations before a horrible
snake—a black cobra, I think; a month later
he worshipped the snake again and your illness increased.
He has come here because Angela wants
him to entertain us with his music hall magic. I am
afraid that he will use the snake. You say you are
to lose your life tomorrow; if George is the cause
of your illness, then that is true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was still leaning toward her, searching her
face in the waning light. He spoke slowly as if his
words were but a surface ripple over a deep lake of
thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is true that my illness is mind-born—I have
known that from the beginning—and that it is not of
myself, and I have tried to discover who could have
thought it on me. It may be, as you suggest, that
George has done it. It is an answer, but why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because of Gloria,” she said. With another
man it would have been difficult to tell her beliefs,
but for the moment it seemed as if they two were
hanging suspended in the dusk-blue bowl of mountain
and sky, and the soul, eager yet indifferent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>life, that looked out of his eyes, commanded absolute
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“George loves her—he is a Hindoo, and for no
other reason would he have been her servant all
these years. At first he understood the prejudices
of a Western woman and realized that he couldn’t
marry her, but I think if you will look back perhaps
now you can see how he separated you and Gloria.
I have never seen the two men who followed, but
I think he must have hypnotized her into marrying
them, and then himself broken the marriages, and
now she is going to marry this horrible Prince Aglipogue.
George is forcing her to do that. He
boasted that it was so to me. It will ruin her career
and make her poor, and break her heart with shame
when she wakes to what she has done. Then George
will claim his reward. He did not mention your
name when he talked to me, but he said, ‘There is
only one other fit to walk beside her, and he is
slowly dying of an unknown disease.’ You see there
is only one link gone from my story and that is how
you let Gloria go at first. Why did you, why did
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the retelling of the story that had occupied her
mind all these weeks, putting all her fears into words,
it seemed that the danger she told had grown fourfold.
When she had tried to tell Terry his very
attitude of uncomprehension had made her story
sound unreal, but when she told it now, she saw belief
and understanding in Pendragon’s eyes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>something else—a resignation that maddened her.
It was as if he watched Gloria being murdered and
made no movement to protect her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, why?” she demanded again, grasping his
arm with tense fingers. She could almost have
shaken him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed quite unmoved by her excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria had met George before we were married,”
he said in his quiet voice. “She found him
ill, you know, and paid his debts and got him a
doctor, and when he was well he wanted to serve
her. I didn’t like him and advised her not to take
him; it would have been much better for him to go
back to his profession, but he begged to come and
she liked him; perhaps his devotion flattered her.
Everything went well until the night when Gloria
was to open in a new play. I never went much to
the theatre. I thought it better to leave her alone
in her professional life, and on this night the planet
Eros—a small planet discovered quite recently in
our new solar system—was to be very near—much
nearer than it had ever been but once before, much
nearer than it would be again for many years. The
first time the astronomers of the world had missed
a wonderful opportunity; this time they were all
watching. We were to take photographs if the
weather permitted; by means of Eros and comparative
calculations we would discover something exact
about the distance and weight of many other planets.
It was the opportunity of a century.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“We had a small flat in London and George was
acting as a sort of butler and sometimes valeting me
as well. I hated having him around, but Gloria said
he was happier when he was busy. I remember now
everything that happened and how he looked at me.
‘You are going to the theatre tonight, Sir?’ he said,
and I had the impression that he often gave me, that
he was being impertinent, almost insulting, though
there was neither impertinence nor insult in his words
or manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No; I’m due at the observatory,’ I answered.
There had been no idea of my going to the opening
in my mind, or in Gloria’s, I think, until that moment,
but when George had left us she turned on me with
reproaches. She said that I took no interest in her
work; that I was jealous of her career and that I
must choose between her and the stars that night.
I dare say I was very stupid, but she seemed quite
strange and unreasonable as I had never seen her
before, and I said some rather nasty things. She
said if I did not go to the theatre she would never
return to the flat. Of course I said that was unnecessary—that
I would go. I did; expecting a
message from her every day. The only message I
got was from her lawyers in Paris, where she had
gone for a divorce. That’s the story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped talking now, but Ruth waited. Over
the hills the rose flush had faded, the thin, keen
blade of the almost disappearing moon hung like a
scimitar in a field of dark purple and resting above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>it a star hung, trembling, as if waiting for the cold
arms of a laggard lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose half confidences won’t do,” he said
at last. “I still love Gloria; what man once having
loved her could forget? ‘Time cannot change nor
custom stale her infinite variety’; but of what use to
fight one’s destiny—in another incarnation, perhaps.
I cannot believe all that you say of George. That
he is a Mahatma is doubtless true, that he loves
Gloria is gruesomely natural, that he hates me and
has put upon me this mind-born malady is reasonable,
but that he should possess, or even aspire to
possess, Gloria is incredible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a sadness on his face, another worldness
in his eyes, but there was no light of battle
there, and Ruth, whose youth and energy cried out
for action, felt as if she were beating with futile
hands against a stone wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he does want her, and he’s going to succeed
if you don’t do something. If he has the power to
kill you, he has the power to do these other things
too. Even if you don’t believe this, you must do
something to save your own life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I’m not very keen about living; if
I die now it is an easy way out—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She wanted to protest that if he had courage he
might yet win Gloria again, but she did not dare
raise hopes that might never be fulfilled. Even if
Gloria were saved from the Prince who could tell
that she might not marry Terry?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“That’s weak, and cowardly,” she said, “and
if you believe in the wisdom of the East you know
that in the next life you will not enjoy the fruit of
any joy for which you have not struggled in this.
You are selfish, too. Even if you no longer care for
your own life, you must do what you can to help
Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She no longer wants anything from me; she
would only resent my interference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are thinking only of yourself—what difference
can her attitude make now? Promise me
that you will do something—promise—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps the voice of youth is the voice to follow—I
am afraid I have grown old and age does not
love knighthood, but I promise that if I see any
way in which to change her destiny and mine, I
will make what effort I can. I will think about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was almost dark now, and Gloria was standing
beside them before they saw her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Angela’s been looking for you; she wants you
to play billiards, Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t know how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That doesn’t make any difference; neither do I
and neither does Miss Gilchrist; you just stand
around and make the men wish that you’d go away
and let them have a good game—but don’t go just
yet,” as Ruth started away. “I want to say something
to Professor Pendragon and I don’t want to
be alone with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth could not see his face very clearly, but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>saw his long white hands clenching over the arms
of his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought, of course, when we met this morning,
that you would find some excuse for going away
on the next train, Percy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should I do that, Gloria? I did not know
you were coming; you did not know I was here. We
have been thrown together for a brief time. Neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Peyton-Russell knows that we have
met before. I have promised to stay over the New
Year. John knows I haven’t any particular business
interest to call me away. I thought the least
conspicuous thing would be to stay. My illness
makes it easy for me to stay much in my own rooms.
We need not meet often, but if you wish, of course,
I can go tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no trace of bitterness or anger in his
voice. He spoke in a cold, casual way as if he were
discussing some rather boring detail of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do wish it very much—Prince Aglipogue has
asked Angela to announce our engagement tomorrow
night. Of course no one but Ruth and Mr.
Riordan knows that we have ever met before, but it
will be awkward for me, even though you seem to
have forgotten everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice, as cold as his at the beginning, deepened
and trembled on the last words, whether with
tears or anger Ruth could not tell. She only knew
that both of these people were suffering as only
proud people can suffer and she did not want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>watch. She tried to slip away, but Gloria’s hand on
her arm restrained her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, Gloria, I don’t see why you should
announce a thing like that; you might as well
make an announcement every time you buy a new
frock.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words could not have cut Gloria more than
they did Ruth. Surely this was not the man who
not fifteen minutes earlier had told her that he still
loved Gloria? If he had hated her he could have
said nothing more rude. She felt Gloria’s hand
tighten on her arm as if for support.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go, then; you need not trouble,” she said
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; forgive me—I will go on the early train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But already Gloria had turned and was walking
away, and Ruth, not knowing what to say, followed,
her heart aching for both the woman and the lonely
man outside. Gloria did not pause nor look back
and Ruth suspected that she dared not turn her face
for fear of disclosing tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warm air inside made Ruth realize for the
first time that, though sheltered, it was very cold
outside. She hesitated, wondering whether to follow
Gloria or to go back and beg Professor Pendragon
not to remain longer out of doors. Gloria decided
her by walking steadily forward and turning into her
own room, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was still sitting where they had left him, staring
out into the blue-black sky. Even his hands still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>clung tightly to the arms of his chair as they had
when she had left him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve just discovered that it’s terrifically cold out
here and you ought to come in,” she said, trying to
speak as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The nurse was to have come out for me a long
time ago; I dare say she saw us talking and went
back. If you think you could push the chair for me—I
haven’t any crutches here—I will go in,” he
answered in the same tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without speaking she moved to the back of the
chair and began wheeling him toward the door. It
really moved very easily. She stopped at the door,
opened it and pushed him through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which door?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That one,” he pointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was next to Gloria’s room and across the hall
from her own. The obvious thought came to her
of how these two, apparently so near, were separated
by a bridgeless ocean of misunderstanding.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“It’s a worse storm than the one that held up
your train; it’s rather Christmasy and all
that, but it’s rather unfortunate, because the
nurse has become alarmed about Professor Pendragon
and he wanted to take the early train back
to New York. We’ve telephoned Dr. Gerstens,
and if it’s possible for anything to travel five miles
through this snow storm he’ll be here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth glanced across the breakfast table at Gloria
while Angela was speaking, but there was no annoyance
on Gloria’s face, only a desperate fear looked
out of her eyes. Again it seemed to Ruth that she
was a trapped bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about the children?” asked Mr. Peyton-Russell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, these storms never last more than a few
hours; by noon it will be over and most of them
can get here—those that only live a few miles away.
They’re accustomed to weather like this—unless
James refuses to take out the horses—James, you
know, thinks more of the horses than he does of
us,” she continued, turning to the others. “You
know every Christmas John has the most beautiful
custom. He gees around to all the farm houses
and collects the children and brings them here to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>play games and enjoy our Christmas tree. I expect
you to help entertain them, Ruth. You’re the youngest
person here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I don’t know much about children,
but I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll help,” said Terry quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew you would,” said Angela, and they all
laughed, though Ruth could see nothing to laugh at.
She was beginning to fear that the events of the last
weeks had dulled her wits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t Pendragon take the afternoon train if it
clears up?” asked Mr. Peyton-Russell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The nurse won’t let him; says he can’t stand
sleeping cars. She simply won’t let him go until
morning—and perhaps when Dr. Gerstens comes
he’ll say it isn’t necessary—though he has looked
rather badly the last few days. You know at first I
quite forgot that he was ill until he would try to
walk. I like him so much—don’t you think it’s
awfully sweet of me to like John’s friends, Gloria?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela was in one of her juvenile moods in which
Gloria usually encouraged her, but now she only
answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, very.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the duty of a good wife to like the friends
of her husband,” said Prince Aglipogue, who by this
time had sufficiently satisfied the first keen edge of
the appetite acquired through the night to begin
taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This remark was a challenge to Miss Gilchrist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>who began a long talk on the duty of every woman
to retain her individuality after marriage, illustrating
her talk with examples of what the unfortunate
man who married her might expect. And no one
was rude enough or brave enough to tell her that
all these plans and warnings on her part were
unnecessary. Ruth didn’t even listen. She had discovered
that Miss Gilchrist never required an
answer to anything she said. She was content if only
allowed to go on talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at such times as these that everything that
Ruth had seen in the past and everything she feared
for the future seemed most unreal and incredible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely here in this warm room with its glowing
fire, its flowers and birds, among these every-day
people, eating breakfast and chatting of ordinary
things, there could be nothing more sinister than the
snow storm outside; and that only seemed to add to
the comfort and good cheer within.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she saw George glide across the far end
of the long room, silent, dark-clad, swift, and she
remembered that this was not only Christmas Eve;
it was also the dark of the moon. The children
would come to play before the Christmas tree in
the afternoon—and at night the doom of the daughter
of Shiva would fall. Later she knew that it was
in this moment that she thought again of the words
of Professor Pendragon: “If I had an enemy I
would destroy his faith in his power to harm,” and
she knew what it was that she must do.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Angela was right. The snow stopped falling before
ten o’clock. They had all been keeping country
hours and had breakfasted at eight, and they all
watched James drive off in the huge sleigh that was
to bring the children to the Christmas party.</p>

<p class='c007'>There would not be as many as usual, for James
had been forced to make a late start and he could
not travel very rapidly in the deep snow and the
children must be there at three o’clock if they were
to start home early in the evening. For these very
good reasons he could not stop at more than four or
five of the very nearest farms. However, as each
farm could provide from two to six children, there
promised to be quite enough to keep Ruth busy if
she was to amuse them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of amusing children rather frightened
Ruth, but she was relieved when Angela took them
to see the tree. It had all been very nicely arranged
with enough mechanical amusement to relieve her
of any very great responsibility. The tree—a very
big one—was in a large room from which most of
the furniture, except a few chairs, had been thoughtfully
removed. Aside from the candles and tinsel
ornaments there were dozens of small gifts, of little
value, but suitable almost for any child, together
with the usual “Christian sweets,” as Terry called
them, which Ruth remembered to have received herself
from Church Christmas trees, and to have seen
nowhere else at any time. Then there was to be tea
with lots of cakes and chocolate and nuts and fruit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and altogether Ruth could see that there would not
be more than one torturing hour in which she would
have to “amuse the children.” Besides they would
probably amuse themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not teach them poetry games?” suggested
Miss Gilchrist, “those lovely things of Vachel Lindsay’s,
where the poetry is interpreted by motion—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better let them play games they know,” said
Angela. “They only have an hour or two, and
there won’t be time to teach them anything new.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, very well. I was only suggesting; of course
if you prefer the old-fashioned, undirected play—but
it seemed to me a splendid opportunity to bring
beauty into the lives of children who might never
have another opportunity of studying it. I have
gone in for child study, you know, quite deeply; I
may say that child culture is my—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth feared that she was going to say it was her
chief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span>, but Angela interrupted with:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll have some little tables brought in
for the tea. Children are so awkward about cups
and things, and perhaps they’ll feel less shy if they’re
all sitting together round a table.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Though her ideas about modern child culture
seemed to meet with so little approval, Miss Gilchrist
did not absent herself from the party. She
was with Ruth and Terry and Mr. and Mrs. Peyton-Russell
while they watched the arrival of the
sleigh load of shouting children. Prince Aglipogue
was, of course, far too dignified to take any interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and Gloria had absented herself since breakfast as
if she feared that she would have to meet Pendragon
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They didn’t seem to mind meeting at all,” Terry
had said to her the day before, but when Angela
had spoken of Professor Pendragon’s dangerous
condition and his plan of returning to the city, Ruth
had caught his glance and knew that he understood
at least in part—at least as much as any one else
could understand. She did not intend to tell him
anything about her own conversation with Pendragon
or the scene between him and Gloria which
she had witnessed. She knew that she had been
there, not so much as a confidante, as an artificial
barrier between two people who otherwise could not
have borne the pain of meeting. The experience
had made her feel very old, and now the idea of
entertaining children seemed almost preposterous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door was opened and the little guests came
trooping into the big hall, but something seemed to
have happened when they clambered out of the
sleigh. They had been laughing after the most approved
manner of childhood. Ruth could swear to
that. She had seen their faces and some of the shrill
shouts had penetrated into the house. Now they
stood, with wide, curious eyes and solemn demeanour,
the little ones were huddling close behind
the older ones and all looking like shy, frightened
wood things. They followed Mr. Peyton-Russell
into the room of the Christmas tree; they looked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>but where were the cries of delight with which Ruth
had expected them to hail this wonder? Beyond shy
“yes” and “no” to questions they said nothing.
They stood like little, wooden images while the maids
separated them from vast quantities of little coats,
sweaters, knitted caps, hoods, mufflers, and overshoes.
Ruth hoped that they would breathe sighs of
relief and begin to look happy after that, but they
didn’t. They stood quite solemnly where they were
and Angela and her husband, who were to return
later to distribute the gifts, fled, leaving them to be
“amused.” The electric candles on the tree had
been lighted, though it was a bright day, and some
of the bolder children drew near to it, but still they
did not talk. It seemed that entrance into the house
had made them strangers to each other as well as
to their hosts, and they looked so dull Ruth wondered,
remembering the hordes of dark-faced children
she had seen playing in Washington Square,
if country children were duller than city children.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me start them,” said Miss Gilchrist, talking
quite audibly as if the children could not hear. “I
have a great way with children.” She threw an
ogreish smile at them as she spoke and one little
girl instinctively drew near to Terry as if for protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, children, what shall we play?” she asked
in what was doubtless intended to be an engaging
tone of voice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>For a long time no one spoke; then a little girl—the
tallest little girl there—whispered just audibly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kissing games.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry grinned delightedly, but Miss Gilchrist
flushed a dark purple.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed,” she said, still in her schoolteacher
voice. “I’m sure the other children do not
want to play games like that. Tell me what you
play at school.” But again there was silence.
Though some of the little boys had giggled, there
were indications that most of the children did want
to play “kissing games,” probably because those
were the only indoor games they knew.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not let them play the games they’re accustomed
to playing—isn’t there one called—er—post-office?”
he questioned the little girl. She nodded
emphatically, and Miss Gilchrist, casting looks expressive
of deep disgust at both Terry and Ruth,
departed. In her absence the children seemed to
gain confidence. They told Terry their names and
recalled to him such details of the fascinating game
of post-office as he had forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>“D’you really mean you never played it?” he
asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry; I didn’t know it was so important.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No child’s education complete without it; but
it’s never too late to mend your ways, so you can
learn now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first Ruth couldn’t help feeling rather ridiculous,
but the children after five minutes of play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>seemed to regard her as one of them, and Terry
was perhaps a bit younger than the youngest boy
there. They progressed from one game to another,
and to Ruth it seemed that every game, no matter
how harmless on the surface, called for some declaration
in rhyme about “the un that I luf best,” followed
by a kiss to prove it, and she was in constant
fear that the etiquette of play would require that
she kiss Terry, but it never did. Evidently Terry
understood these things far better than she did, for
while he kissed every little maid in the room and
every little boy made declaration of his love for
her, they never had to kiss each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still it was a relief when tea was brought in; a
relief to the children as well, if one could judge by
the enthusiasm with which they greeted it, and afterward
John Peyton-Russell and Angela and Gloria
and even Prince Aglipogue came in to see the distribution
of gifts.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all sat in rows, “Like in Sunday School,”
as Ruth heard one of the little girls whisper, while
Mr. Peyton-Russell made a little speech and gave
out the gifts. Gloria’s cheeks were flushed and her
eyes were unnaturally bright, Ruth thought, but as
always under stress of emotion, she was hiding behind
words, amusing words with a touch of acid
behind them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He used to invite the parents, too,” she told
Ruth; “sort of lord of the manor pose; but he
found that American farmers do not lend themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>well to the tenantry idea; they came and then sent
him invitations as a return of hospitality. They
simply would not be faithful retainers, and then”—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid Aggie’s being bored—not enough to
drink for one thing—Angela is so conservative—dinner
tonight will cheer him—some more people
coming; the Brixtons and their guests, I think. Hope
Percy has the good grace to keep to his rooms even
though he didn’t leave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He couldn’t, you know, because of the storm
this morning,” defended Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say, is he going to die, do you think?” she
asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—what made you ask that?” Ruth felt her
eyes shifting in spite of her efforts to meet Gloria’s
clear gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—something in the look of him
when we left him there in his wheel chair—you know
everything is finished for us, but still it would be
terrible! I should hate to have Percy die, though
God knows I have enough ex-husbands to be able to
spare just one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her shrill, mirthless laughter rose above the
chatter of the children’s voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t, Gloria—please don’t—I can’t bear it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, child—are you—do you love
Percy?” Her voice had changed now, all the hardness
gone from it—it was almost the mother tone.
Her words startled Ruth more than anything that
had gone before.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Love Professor Pendragon? Of course not. I
like him awfully well—I’m afraid I think you’ve
treated him very badly and perhaps I’m sorry for
him, but I never thought of him in any other way.
What made you ask that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria listened, at first with a little puzzled line
between her perfect brows, and then, convinced of
Ruth’s sincerity, her face cleared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—something Terry said first gave
me the idea. I think he got the impression from
something you said. And it wouldn’t be so strange,
would it? Percy <i>is</i> attractive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Much more attractive than that horrible creature,”
said Ruth, glancing in Prince Aglipogue’s
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria shrugged her shoulders and did not reply.
One could say anything to Gloria. She was never
offended because people did not agree with her, nor
did the opinions of other people change or influence
her own actions or beliefs in any way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth did not try to talk any more. She was thinking
of what Gloria had said about Terry. If Terry
thought that she was interested in Pendragon—if
she could have made a mistake like this—wasn’t it
possible that she had made a mistake in thinking
that Terry loved Gloria? Somehow since their adventure
on the train together he had not seemed so
inaccessible. Reason had told her that he was
unattainable, but something stronger than reason had
told another story. There had been an indefinable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>something different in his attitude toward her during
the last few days—something like a prelude—something
for which they were both waiting. Still,
she must not deceive herself with false hopes.
There were so many things for which she was waiting—things
that would happen now she knew
within a very few hours.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The other guests had come, so that there were
twelve people around the Christmas Eve
dinner table, among them Professor Pendragon,
in whose quiet face Ruth thought she read
some new resolve. Surely he must have some purpose
in thus joining the others when he knew that
tonight Gloria’s engagement to Prince Aglipogue
would be announced, and when his illness would
have made his absence seem quite plausible. He
moved about so unobtrusively as to make his infirmity
almost unnoticed, and now, seated beside
Ruth, she found it difficult to believe that he was
really paralysed. She talked to him of trivial
things, ordinary dinner chat, or listened to the
others, wondering within herself what secrets lay
behind those smiling masks of triviality.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Gloria and Pendragon, who had once been married,
could meet thus as strangers, if she and Terry
knowing their secret, or at least a part of it, could
calmly pretend to the world that they did not know,
might not all these other people have secrets, too—old
memories that wine would not drown, meetings
and partings whose pleasure or pain even time could
not dim—immortal loves and hates still living, but
sealed securely in coffins of conventionality?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Hundreds of candles flashed against dark walls,
stained to a semblance of old age; bright scarlet
holly berries nestled against their green waxen
leaves, and dark, red roses shed their heavy perfume
over everything. The dinner was being a
great success, for there were no awkward lulls in
conversation, and, while Ruth in her youth and innocence
did not know it, Angela Peyton-Russell was
blessed with an excellent cook, without whose
services the faces of the men present would not have
been so happy. Ruth did not even observe what she
ate, but Prince Aglipogue, upon whose face sat heavy
satisfaction, could have told to the smallest grain
of condiment exactly what each dish contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one suggested that there were enough people
to dance, and Angela, realizing the advantages of
spontaneity in entertainment, eagerly acquiesced.
They would dance for an hour or two after dinner
and she would have her little “show” later; but
the guests themselves would have to supply the music.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Prince, who could be agreeable when he
chose, immediately offered his services and his violin
if Miss Gilchrist would accompany him with the
piano.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would all be just like an old-fashioned country
dance, and “so delightfully Bohemian,” Angela
thought. She was tremendously happy over the success
of her Christmas party, and her husband was
tremendously satisfied because of the success of his
beautiful wife in the luxury of his beautiful home;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>but Ruth’s heart ached whenever she heard Gloria’s
liquid laughter because there were tears in it, and
in the steady fire of Professor Pendragon’s dark
eyes she saw a flame more pitiful than the funeral
pyre of a Sati.</p>

<p class='c007'>He talked a little, very quietly of trivial things,
sometimes to her, sometimes to the others, and Ruth
took courage from his calmness. Only as the party
grew more gay it seemed to her that under all the
sparkle and the gaiety there was a silence louder
than the noise, like the heavy hush that falls on
nature before the thunder clap and the revealing
flash have ushered in a storm. So strong was this
sense of waiting that when their host stood with
upraised glass, her hand instinctively went out and
rested for a brief second on Professor Pendragon’s
arm, as if she would shield him. Then she saw
Terry looking at her, and remembering what Angela
had said to her that afternoon, she quickly
withdrew it. There had been no need to touch him,
for Pendragon, like the others at the table, turned
his attention to John Peyton-Russell, listening to his
words as if they held no especial significance for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want John to make the announcement,” Angela
had said. “It gives him such pleasure to make
speeches. He simply adores it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently she knew her husband’s tastes, for with
the halting words and awkward phraseology of the
man accustomed to addressing nothing gayer than a
board of directors’ meeting, he stumbled at great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>length and with obvious self-satisfaction through a
speech in which he proposed that they drink to the
approaching marriage of Gloria Mayfield and
Prince Aglipogue.</p>

<p class='c007'>His words were greeted with enthusiasm by all
those to whom they meant nothing except that a
more or less famous actress was to marry a fat
foreign prince. Ruth heard a woman near her
whisper to the man at her right:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will this make her third or her fourth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the response:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve lost count.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Prince was responding now—something
stilted and elaborate, but Ruth did not hear. The
dinner had become a nightmare. She wanted to
escape. Concealed in the girdle of her frock was
the little revolver that Terry had given her. She
could feel its weight, and it comforted her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somehow the dinner ended and Ruth with the
others followed Angela to a drawing-room that had
been denuded of rugs for dancing. A few months
before Ruth would have thought all these people
charming, the women beautiful, the men distinguished.
Now they were repulsive to her. How
could they listen unprotesting to the announcement
that Gloria, the beautiful and good (no power on
earth could have persuaded Ruth that Gloria was
not good), was to marry an ugly ogre like Prince
Aglipogue?</p>

<p class='c007'>His fat face wreathed in smiles now, he stood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>tucking his violin under his third chin, and then he
played—he played, and even Ruth forgot the source
of the music. It was not Prince Aglipogue that
played, but some slender, dark Hungarian gypsy
whose music was addressed to an unattainable
princess, ’neath whose window he stood, bathed in
moonlight. She threw a rose to him and he crushed
it against a heart that broke with joyous pain of
loving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some little time he played before any one danced;
then the insensate callousness of people who “must
be amused” triumphed over the music and the
stupid gyrations of the modern dance which every
one had been forced to learn in self-protection—for
those who do not dance must watch, and the
insult to the eyes is too great to be borne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps after all the music of Aglipogue’s violin
did move them; perhaps it was only that they had
dined too well; perhaps because the company was
so small that twice men found themselves dancing
with their own wives; for any, or all, or none of
these reasons, they tired of dancing early and were
ready for Angela’s much-advertised “show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry had been dancing with Ruth, and she knew
that there was something that he wanted to say to
her. She guessed that it was something about
Gloria, but she did not want to talk to Terry about
Gloria. He could not understand and she regretted
that she had tried to make him understand. She
could not discuss Gloria with any one, not even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Terry. She knew what she had to do and her whole
mind was set on that. If she talked to Terry his
lack of faith would weaken her purpose. She left
him now, abruptly, ignoring the look of reproach
in his eyes, and walked beside Professor Pendragon,
who was moving slowly on his crutches, a little behind
the others. She meant to stay close beside him
through the rest of the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the room that had been the scene of the children’s
party that afternoon a stage had been put up—a
low platform covered with a black velvet carpet
and divided in half by a black curtain on which the
signs of the Zodiac were embroidered in gold thread.
The Christmas tree was still in the room, but unlighted
and shoved away into an obscure corner. To
Ruth it looked pitiful, like an old man, Father
Christmas perhaps, who sat back watching with sorrowful
eyes the unchristmas-like amusements of
modern humanity. There was a piano on the
stage. For a woman who was herself “unmusical,”
Angela had more pianos in her house than any one
in the world, Ruth decided.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a semicircle, very close to the stage, chairs had
been placed, and here the company seated themselves,
with much more or less witty comment about
what they might expect from behind the mysterious
curtain. Behind them was another row of chairs,
which, carrying out Mr. Peyton-Russell’s “lord of
the manor” pose, the household servants had been
invited to occupy. They came, with quiet curiosity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>one or two of the maids stifling yawns that led
Ruth to suspect they would much rather have gone
to bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The semi-circular arrangement of the chairs made
those at the ends of the row much closer to the
stage than those in the centre. On one of these
end chairs sat Professor Pendragon, his crutches
resting beside him on the floor, and next to him sat
Ruth. Then came some of the dinner guests, the
other house guests, including Gloria and Prince Aglipogue,
being at the farther end of the row; the room
was dimly lighted and the stage itself had only one
light, a ghostly green lamp, seemingly suspended in
the middle of the black curtain, in the shape of a
waning moon. Instinctively voices were hushed and
people talked to each other in whispers. Only Ruth
and Professor Pendragon did not speak. She could
not know of what he was thinking, but she knew
that in herself thought was suspended. She sat
watching her hand clasping the tiny revolver concealed
in her girdle.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Peyton-Russell then announced that Miss
Gilchrist (if she had a Christian name no one ever
heard it) had consented to recite some of her own
poems. The relaxation of the company, almost
visible, was half disappointment, half relief. The
stage set had led them to expect something unusual,
and they were only going to be bored.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gilchrist seated herself at the piano, on
which she accompanied herself. Ruth did not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>if her words were as bad as her music, for she did
not understand them, and from certain whispered
comments she knew that no one else did, with the
possible exception of Miss Gilchrist herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one else—a pretty, blond young thing with
a “parlour voice,” sang an old English Christmas
carol that sounded like sacrilege. Then Prince
Aglipogue sang. Ruth never hated him so much as
when he sang because then as at no other time he
created the illusion of an understanding soul. His
painting was obvious trickery; his violin playing of
a quality that did not discredit the composer, for he
had been trained to a parrot-like perfection; but
when he sang he created the illusion of greatness—Purcell,
Brahms, Richard Strauss—it did not matter
whose music he sang; one felt that he understood,
and it angered Ruth that when she closed her eyes
she forgot the singer and could understand how
Gloria might marry and even love the possessor of
this voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aglipogue always maintained that the war had
ruined his career. He had an opera engagement in
Germany in 1914, and when the war came he could
not go to fill it. So he had remained in the States,
and his amazing versatility had enabled him to earn
a living as an artist. Now the end of the war had
opened new opportunities and he was going to South
America in concert work. Ruth had never quite believed
his boasting. She did not think that any man’s
work could be bigger than himself—that any artist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>could express something bigger than that contained
in his own soul; and the soul of Prince Aglipogue
was a weak, cowardly, hateful thing. Yet his voice
moved her, attracted and repelled, cast a spell over
her, exotic, fascinating, yet sinister as if the music
were only a prelude to the wicked necromancy of
the Hindoo that was to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice ceased, and Prince Aglipogue, alone of
all the company unmoved by his own voice, resumed
his place at Gloria’s side. For a brief breathing
minute no one moved. John Peyton-Russell seemed
to have forgotten his cue. Then he rose and told
them that the real surprise was to come, an exhibition
of magic by Karkotaka, a famous Indian
Mahatma. It was the first time that Ruth had ever
heard George’s Hindoo name and she suspected that
it was no more his real name than was George. She
thought she remembered an Indian story in which a
certain Karkotaka figured as king of the serpents,
a sort of demi-god.</p>

<p class='c007'>All eyes were on the dark curtain now, but if they
expected it to rise or to be drawn aside they were
disappointed. Instead, it parted silently and Karkotaka,
George, glided through, dressed not in the costume
of a Brahman, but of a mediæval prince of
India. Instead of a turban he wore a high jewelled
headdress. A single piece of cloth, dark blue in
colour and gemmed with small gold stars, was draped
about him, leaving one arm and shoulder bare, and
descending to his feet, which were encased in jewelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>sandals. Even Ruth, who had expected something
extraordinary, gasped as he stood bowing before
them. The dignity that had shown even through
his servant’s dress was now one hundred times more
apparent. He moved with a lithe grace as became
the king of the serpents, slowly moving his bare
bronze arms until it seemed to Ruth they coiled and
writhed like living snakes. Under his headdress
his eyes gleamed more brightly than the jewels
above.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had come upon the stage with nothing in his
hands, and except for the piano it was empty, certainly
empty of all the paraphernalia of legerdemain.
Then, suddenly he held in his hand a small
brass bowl. He made a sign to some one in the
back of the room, who had evidently been detailed
to help him, and a servant gave him a carafe of
ice water. This he set down beside the bowl. Then
he offered the bowl to the spectators for examination.
Ruth noticed that he was so close to them that
it was not even necessary to step down from the
low stage. Two or three men who “Never saw a
trick yet I couldn’t see through” examined the bowl
with sceptical eyes and pronounced it quite ordinary.
Then George poured ice water from the carafe into
the bowl and again offered it for inspection. Several
people touched it with their hands and pronounced
the water with which it was quite filled to be ice
cold. Then George set the bowl down before him
and covered it with a small silk handkerchief. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>waved his hands over it three times, removed the
handkerchief, and they saw steam rising from the
ice water. Again George offered the bowl for inspection.
Terry dipped his fingers into the water
and as quickly removed them with an exclamation
of pain. The water was almost too hot to touch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then from nowhere appeared the little mound of
sand and watering pot indispensable to any self-respecting
Indian fakir. Several people whispered,
“The mango tree—that’s an old one.” Throughout
George had not spoken one word. He seemed
to be unconscious of his audience except when
he asked them to examine something. To Ruth
there seemed in his studied leisure a conscious effort
to disguise haste. He bent now over the sand, pouring
water on it and pressing it up into a little hillock
of mud; then he covered it with a cloth, beneath
which his hands were still busy. Then he moved
away and seemed to be muttering charms. When he
returned and removed the cloth there was the little
mango sprout with its two leathery leaves. Again
the plant was covered, next time to appear several
inches tall with more leaves, and so on until it had
reached a height of more than a foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was all very wonderful, as was also the
fountain of water that sprang from the tip of his
index finger, until he seemed to chide it, whereupon
it disappeared from his hand and was seen spouting
from the top of the piano. Dissatisfied, he lit a
candle and, calling to the water, made it spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>from the candle flame itself. Then he called again,
spread out his arms, and the stream, leaving the
still lighted candle, separated and sprang from his
five outspread fingertips.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an ordinary music hall the people who watched
would doubtless have conceded that it was clever,
but here in an ordinary drawing-room in an ordinary
country house in the Berkshires on Christmas
Eve, the performance became something more than
legerdemain. It bordered on the supernatural and
they sat silent and fascinated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly with an annoyed gesture he threw up
his hands, apparently throwing off the water, which
instantaneously began to flow in myriad streams
from his headdress, reminding Ruth of Shiva, who,
with his hair, separated the flow of the sacred river
when it came down from the Himalayas. George
removed his headdress, disclosing a close white turban
beneath, and the flow of the fountain died as
unceremoniously as it had begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant who was standing nearby waiting
for his signal now handed George an ordinary walking
stick, which George silently offered for inspection.
After some examination it was agreed that it
was a very ordinary walking stick indeed. George
whirled it about his head and dropped it before his
feet—it was a writhing snake. Several women
screamed. Fountains were pretty, but they were in
no mood for snakes. George picked up the snake
again and whirled it around his head. It was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>ordinary walking stick, though the men hesitated to
re-examine it for proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>George balanced the stick on his finger, holding
his arm out straight before him, and it began to
writhe and twist, a snake with open, hissing mouth
and darting tongue. He dropped it—the same
women screamed again, then laughed hysterically as
they saw the common piece of wood before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This sort of thing is all very well from a distance,
but I don’t really care for snakes at such close
quarters,” Ruth heard some one whisper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth glanced at Professor Pendragon beside her,
but his eyes were fixed on George. There was an
eager light in his eyes as if he, too, were waiting, and
his firm set lips were curved in a smile. Again her
hand sought Terry’s gift. If all these people here
were the victims of hypnotic illusions, she at least
must keep one corner of her brain free and untouched.
Pendragon’s presence there was proof
that he had decided to fight, and she must help him.
In the semi-darkness of the room she could not see
Gloria, but she heard her laughter like thin bells
over snow-covered hills—it seemed to echo round
the room, and she fancied that George, bending over
the task of clearing away the things with which he
had been working, winced as he heard it, as if the
frost of her mirth had bitten into his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stage was all clear again now, and he bowed
deeply before them three times. There was a restless
movement among the watchers. Perhaps they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>thought this was the end, but Ruth waited, her
heart high up in her throat and standing still with
fear that she would somehow fail to do the thing
she had decided upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>George moved slowly backward toward the curtain
and parted it with his two hands, still facing
them. Then reaching back he grasped a heavy
object behind him and dragged it into the centre
of the stage, the curtains closing behind him.
He stood back now and they could see what looked
like a large ebony chest. He knelt before it, and
Ruth could see that there was more of reverence
than utility in his attitude, as he lifted the deep lid
that seemed to divide the chest in half. Before her
eyes she saw forming the altar she had twice seen
before. The side of the lifted top made a wide
platform. It was there that <i>It</i> would lie. From a
compartment in the lifted half he took an antique
lamp, which he set on what now looked like the base
of the altar. Ruth had removed the revolver from
her girdle—the cold metal saved her from screaming
aloud as George lit the lamp—a pale blue flame
from which, on the instant, heavy, odorous spirals
of smoke began to rise, filling the silent room with
the insidious perfume of idolatry. For a moment
the smoke seemed to blind her eyes. Then she
saw—</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>A sigh, more like a gasp, ran through the
room—from nowhere apparently, by some
trick of slight of hand, by some optical illusion,
by some power of hypnosis, they all saw a huge
snake coiled on top of what had been an ebony chest,
but was now an altar, and before it knelt a priest
whose last incarnation had surely been thousands of
years before kind Buddha came to bless or curse
the world with his doctrine of annihilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then for the first time Karkotaka moved his lips
in audible speech—swaying on his knees before the
altar, he chanted what no one could doubt was a
hymn of praise and supplication to the snake that
lay coiled inert above the lamp. For some moments
he chanted while they waited with held breath,
fascinated, repelled, frightened, for once in their
sophisticated lives, into silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the coiled mass began to move—its head
was raised and they could see its cold, glittering
eyes; it seemed to be swaying as Karkotaka swayed
in time to the chant. The clouds of incense grew
thicker and they could scarcely see each other’s faces
had they looked, but their eyes were held by the
tableau on the stage, the kneeling, swaying, chanting
priest and the reptile that swayed in response. Ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>higher and higher reared the evil head, swaying
always further and further toward the end of the
semicircle at which Ruth and Pendragon were sitting.
Ruth sensed his presence at her side and knew
the tenseness of his waiting, but she dared not turn
her eyes toward him for one moment. Higher and
higher rose the chant until with a swift movement
and a shout Karkotaka stood upon his feet. In the
same moment the snake reared to its full height,
hissing with open mouth toward them. In that instant
Ruth shot. In the confusion she was conscious
of thinking that she must have hit the snake right
between the eyes, for it fell to the floor with scarcely
a movement, and George stood, staring stupidly
down at it. Every one was on their feet—every one
speaking at once, though she could not understand
what they said. She could only stare at the revolver
in her hand. It all happened in such a swift moment—then
her head was clear—Gloria had fainted—they
were trying to give her air. Some one of the
bewildered, frightened servants turned on the lights.
Professor Pendragon strode past her, and though
Ruth saw the smoking revolver in his hand, it carried
no message to her brain. Thrusting aside Prince
Aglipogue, who was kneeling futilely over Gloria,
he picked her up in his arms and carried her out,
and in the general excitement no one thought to
wonder at his miraculous cure. Angela had followed
Pendragon, but Ruth with the others stood gazing
at the horrible enchantment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Who did it?—who shot the thing?” she heard
some one ask.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did.” She held up her revolver. “I killed
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me see.” It was Terry standing beside her.
He took the revolver from her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry, Ruth, but I’m afraid you didn’t. It was
Pendragon. I was watching him and saw him aim
and fire. It was a splendid shot even for an expert
and at such short range, for the filthy brute was
moving and he hit it right between the eyes. You
see, child—” he opened the revolver for her to look—“there
hasn’t been a single shot fired from your
gun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, though she had never done anything so
mid-Victorian in her life before, she swayed and for
the smallest fraction of a second lost consciousness,
then woke to the realization that Terry was supporting
her and straightened up with protestations
that she was all right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why did you, why did he do it? We were
going to see something quite wonderful—I think
the Indian snake dances are—”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Miss Gilchrist, but no one had to answer
her, for Mr. Peyton-Russell came in just then to
tell them that Miss Mayfield was quite all right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Angela’s going to stay with her for a while,
but if any of you don’t feel that your nerves are
quite ready for bed, come on down to the billiard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>room. There’s a little drink—real, old-fashioned
hot Scotch, waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was trying hard to be the imperturbable
jovial host and perhaps he succeeded for there was
a general exodus. Terry looked questioningly at
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>She shook her head. She wanted above everything
to get away from them. They would sit over
their drinks and gossip discreetly—discuss George,
why Pendragon had killed the snake, his sudden return
to health, his usurpation of Aglipogue’s place
at Gloria’s side. She had not killed the snake but
she had gone through all the nervous strain of preparing
to kill it—of thinking she had killed it and
she was very tired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terry walked with her as far as the staircase.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tomorrow,” he said, but she did not know what
he meant. Yet she slept that night. She was in
that state of weariness mental and physical in which
one stretches out like a cat, feeling the cool, clean
linen like a caress and thanking God for the greatest
blessing in all this tired world—sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>She woke late with a sense of happiness and relief
even before she was sufficiently conscious to
remember the events of the past night. It was a
wonderful Christmas day—sunshiny and bright.
She lay quietly thinking, looking at the holly
wreaths at her windows and watching some snow
birds on her sill. She wished lazily that she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>some crumbs to feed them. She felt very young,
almost like a child. It would be nice to be a child
again, to get up and explore the contents of a stocking
hung before the chimney place in the living-room
of a Middle West home. She thought of her
mother, as one inevitably thinks of the dead on
days of home gathering, and soft tears filled her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>She answered a discreet knock on the door and
a maid entered with a tray. It was the gossipy maid
of her first day. How she knew that she was awake
Ruth could not guess.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you’d rather have breakfast in bed
this morning, Miss,” and then as an afterthought,
“Merry Christmas, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merry Christmas— It is a Merry Christmas
after all, and I would like breakfast in bed, though
it makes me feel awfully lazy. How did you think
of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mistress left orders last night, but I’d
thought of it anyway—after what we all went
through last night—”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shook her head and compressed her lips
solemnly. Ruth looked at her, willing to be interested
in anything or anybody. She could not have
been much older than Ruth herself, but hard work
and a coiffure composed of much false hair surmounted
by a preposterously small maid’s cap, made
her seem much more mature. As Ruth did not
answer she went on:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“Such goings on—it’s a wonder we’re all alive
to tell of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you didn’t like the show?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such things ain’t Christian, especially on the
Lord’s birthday. Tell me, Miss, was it you killed
it—some said it was you and some said it was the
poor paralysed gentleman, who was cured so miraculous
like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was Professor Pendragon. Have you seen
him today?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, we’ve all seen him. He’s walking
round all over the place, and he’s give ev-er-ey servant
in the house a five dollar gold piece!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This amazing piece of information gave Ruth a
shock. In her selfish absorption in Gloria and herself
she hadn’t thought of the servants and the inevitable
toll of Christmas gifts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know, Jennie, I didn’t buy any gifts
before I came up here and I almost forgot, but I
want to give you a present—” She was just about
to offer money, and then something in the kind,
stolid face warned her that this would be wrong.
“I’d like to give you something of my own that you
like. If you’ll just tell me what you want you can
have anything of mine—any dress or hat or—well,
just anything you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl’s eyes spread wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, anything, that is, if I have anything you
like. If not I’ll have to follow Professor Pendragon’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>example and give you money to buy your
own gift.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got such lots of pretty clothes—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth thought her wardrobe very limited, but
waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is one dress—not a party dress—I’ve always
wanted one—there ain’t any place to wear it,
but if you could—do you really mean it—anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course,” said Ruth, expecting a request for
one of her three presentable evening gowns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I’d like that blue silk thing with the lots
of lace—the thing you wear here in your own
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She pointed to a negligée thrown over a chair by
the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take it; it will make me very happy to know
that you have it.” She tried to visualize Jennie in
the negligée, but the picture was not funny. She
turned her head away so that Jennie should not see
the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll most likely be getting a lot of things
yourself, Miss; a man’s gone down to the village for
the mail. You’ll be getting a lot of things from the
city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid not; still I may get some letters
which will be welcome.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go down and see—he may be back. He
went early.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was back in an incredibly short space of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>minutes bearing one letter, from Dorothy Winslow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Miss Mayfield wants to know if you’ll
come to her room when you’re dressed,” said
Jennie, who, seeing that Ruth was going to read her
letter, left her with another hurried, awkward
“thank you, Miss,” delivered through the door as
she hurried off with her blue silk prize.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dorothy’s Christmas letter fairly bubbled over
with happiness, and with an affection for Ruth which
she had never suspected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems ages since you went away,” she wrote,
“and I’m just dying to tell you everything—how
Nels was awfully humble and admitted he’s been
a perfect silly over that imitation high siren, and
then he was jealous—furiously jealous over your
roses. It was hard not to tell him the truth, but I
didn’t—not until afterward, when he asked me to
marry him. Yes, he did! And we’ve done it.
Neither of us had any money, but that didn’t really
make any difference. He’s always been able to buy
his own cigarettes and so have I and there’s no reason
why we can’t do it together just as well as apart.
We’ve got the funniest little apartment on Thirty-fourth
Street—just a room with an alcove and a
bath and a kitchenette. Nels is going to get another
place to work—one room some place—very business-like
and all that sort of thing and I’ll work at
home. But please do hurry back and have dinner
with us sometime. You’ll see! I <i>can</i> cook. But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>must work, too, else Nels will get ever so many
leagues ahead of me. And please have you delivered
my message to the Dragon? You did give
him Nels’ message I know for Nels heard from him
and that man with the double name who is so splendidly
entertaining you over the holidays is going to
buy the picture. You must get back in time for the
party we’ll put on to celebrate when the check
comes. You know I feel that you made it all happen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She chatted on over ten pages of art school gossip
that made Ruth rather homesick, and eager to get
back to New York, especially as the first object of
her visit had been accomplished. But had it been
accomplished? The snake was killed and Professor
Pendragon was cured. To her the connection
seemed obvious. Professor Pendragon had been
cured because the object of George’s faith had
been destroyed and with it the mind-born malady
which, through faith, he had put upon the man who
was his rival. But this did not accomplish all of
Ruth’s desire. There still remained the Prince.
Even though George’s power over Pendragon had
been destroyed, might he not still exercise the same
influence over Gloria? And would George calmly
submit to the insult that had been put upon him?
Her whole trust was now in Pendragon. He had
shown that he could fight. Having gone so far he
must go further and drive away Prince Aglipogue.
Then every one would be happy—that is, every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>except herself and Terry. She was no longer sure
that Terry loved Gloria. Probably he had loved
her because no man could be indifferent to Gloria,
but perhaps he had resigned himself to the unromantic
rôle of friend. He had suspected her of
being interested in Pendragon for herself. That
might mean anything—his thought might have been
fathered by the hope that some one would remove
Pendragon, one of his own rivals; or perhaps she
had betrayed her love for him and he wanted to
turn her attention toward another object, or perhaps—but
men were such curious creatures and who
could tell? At least he did not love her which was
all that really mattered now. Nels and Dorothy
could go working and playing together through the
future, but she must content herself to be wedded
for life to her art; and such art—newspaper cartoons!</p>

<p class='c007'>While she thought she was dressing, for she was
really very curious to see Gloria and hear what she
had to say. The door of Gloria’s room was half
open and Ruth knocked and went inside at the same
moment. Gloria was fully dressed and seemed to
be in the midst of packing. There were dark circles
under her eyes as if she had not slept.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ruth, I want you to do something for me,” was
her abrupt greeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth waited for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, Gloria,—anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“I believe you would at that—you’re an awfully
nice child; sometimes I suspect that you’re older
than I am; but this is something rather nasty, so
don’t be too sure that you’ll want to do it. I want
you to tell Aggie that I can’t marry him—that I
must have been insane when I said I would, that the
whole thing is utterly impossible—that it would
please me if he would go back to New York at
once. I don’t want to see him any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth struggled to conceal her joy at this announcement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think, Gloria, that it would be more
effective if you told him yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; and besides I don’t want to see the brute—he—he— Oh,
I can’t bear to look at him—to
remember everything—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose he doesn’t believe me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You could write a note.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he wouldn’t believe; a note would be too
gentle. He’d want to see me and talk, but if you
tell him he’ll know that it’s final or I wouldn’t have
chosen to tell him through a third person. Will you
do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was going to leave myself,” explained Gloria
with a wave of her hand toward the evidences of
packing. “But I can’t. George has disappeared—absolutely
disappeared—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When—where?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“I said disappeared; that doesn’t mean he left
a forwarding address. He slipped off into the
nowhere, sometime between midnight and morning
and of course I can’t move until we hear from
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can, too!” Ruth was intense in her excitement.
“You can—you’ve given up the Prince; the
next thing is to give up George. He’s been the
cause of all your troubles. I know you don’t believe
it, but he has—he’s hypnotized you—and if he’s
disappeared you ought to be glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria looked at her curiously from between
half-closed lids.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you think I won’t believe you? I
don’t believe or disbelieve, I know that I have been
hypnotized, or mad, or ill—something. I woke up
this morning quite new— Perhaps it’s religion—”
She laughed with something of her old careless
mirth. “Anyway I’m quite sane now, and I do
want to get back to New York so that I can begin
rehearsals in Terry’s new play. I feel like working
hard, like beginning all over again— I feel—so—so
free, that’s the word, as if I had been in prison—a
prison with mirror walls, every one of which reflected
a distorted vision of myself. That’s all I
could see—myself, always myself and always
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I come in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Angela at the still half-open door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you’re not leaving?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“No; I only thought I was. Changed my mind
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’re quite well. The poor, dear Prince
has been quite frantic. He’s so anxious to see you
for himself before he will be assured that you’re
really all right, after the shock last night. He’s
waiting for you now. The other men have gone off
on a hike through the snow. John has such a passion
for exercise—afraid of getting stout, though
he won’t admit it. I told the Prince that I would
try and send you down to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t go now. Ruth will go down and talk to
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ruth? But he wants you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A sign from Gloria counselled Ruth to go now
before the discussion, and she slipped out unnoticed
by Angela whose blue eyes were fixed on Gloria,
awaiting explanations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Aglipogue was not difficult to find. She
could hear his heavy pacing before she had reached
the bottom of the stairs. He stopped abruptly when
he saw her approaching, waving his cigarette frantically
with one hand while he twisted his moustache
with the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gloria, Miss Mayfield, she is well; you have
news from her? She is coming down?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mayfield is well, but she is not coming
down just now. She wants to be alone, but she sent
me—”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible to tell him. Much as she hated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the man she did not quite have the courage to deliver
Gloria’s message without preliminaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes? Yes?—speak, tell me; she is ill, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a nervous apprehension in his voice
and manner that made Ruth suspect that the news
would not be altogether unexpected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; she is not ill. As I said she is quite well,
but she asked me to say—to tell you—it’s awfully
hard to say it, but she asked me to tell you that she
cannot marry you and that it would be very tactful
if you would go back to New York at once without
trying to see her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was blunderingly done, but she could think of
no other way to tell it. Unwelcome truths are only
made more ugly by any effort to soften their harshness.</p>

<p class='c007'>His cigarette dropped unnoticed upon the rug and
his jaw dropped in a stupid way that made him look
like a great pig. One part of Ruth’s brain was
really sorry for him, for he had doubtless been fond
of Gloria in his own way; the other half of her
brain wanted to laugh, but she only stood with bent
head, as if, having struck him she was waiting for
his retaliation. It came with a rush as soon as he
had assimilated the full meaning of her words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe—it is a plot—she would not
send a message such as that to me—it is the work
of that Riordan— He is jealous—. I will sue her
for breach of promise—one can do that, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Women sometimes sue men for breach of
promise,” said Ruth, who was quite calm now, “but
men seldom sue women; besides, you can’t sue
Gloria, because she has no money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No money?” He laughed and lit another
cigarette to give point to his carelessness and unbelief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say she has no money? With a house on
Gramercy Park, she is poor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind his words and his nonchalant air Ruth
caught the uneasiness in his small eyes and knew
that she had struck the right note.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is true that she has a house on Gramercy
Square, but it takes her entire income to pay the
taxes. She got the house from her second husband;
the third was more careful. He only gave her a
small income, which, of course, she loses when she
remarries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment he stared at her incredulous, but
there was nothing but honesty in her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the truth, you are speaking? Come, let us
sit and talk—here a cigarette? No? You do not
smoke? I had forgotten. We have not been such
friends as I might have desired. Now explain—Miss
Mayfield wishes to break her engagement with
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has broken it,” said Ruth tersely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is, you can understand, a shock of the greatest—I
loved—but no matter—tell me again of the
affairs financial of Miss Mayfield. As a friend only—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>am resigned—as a friend only I am interested.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at him, his heavy body, his fat face,
his oily brown eyes, and was tempted to tell him
the truth of what she thought. He laid one fat
hand on hers with a familiar gesture and involuntarily
she drew back as if something unclean had
touched her. He saw but pretended not to see. He
had an object to achieve and could not afford to be
sensitive. She understood and thought it all out before
she spoke. If she followed her impulse he
would cause trouble, or annoyance to Gloria at the
least. If she told him the truth he would believe
her and would go away without further urging.
Evidently he had thought that Gloria had money,
and Gloria, to whom money meant nothing, had
never thought to tell him anything of her affairs.
It was a repulsive task but Ruth decided to give
him the information he wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must understand,” she said, “that Gloria
is merely a professional woman, an actress, not an
heiress. She has no money except what she earns.
One of her husbands gave her the house on Gramercy
Park. A year later she married again and
when she was divorced from her last husband he
settled on her a small income—hardly sufficient to
keep up the house when she is not working. If she
marries again she loses even that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She rose to leave him, having finished with her
mission, but he caught her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“You are speaking the truth, Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She drew away her hand without answering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you? Perhaps you have been helping
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have even less than Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His amazing lack of finesse—his appalling vulgarity
stunned her into making a reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a train in the morning—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is one this afternoon that you can catch
if you will hurry. I advise you to take it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, I will—you have saved me a great
deal of annoyance. I am grateful—if—”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Ruth did not wait for the end of his remarks.
She could not bear to look at him for another second.
He was even worse than she had supposed.
Evidently he had not cared for Gloria at all, and
she had always conceded to him that much—that
Gloria had touched some one small bit of fineness
in his sordid nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>She dared not return to Gloria just then, for she
knew that Gloria in her usual frank manner had
doubtless told Angela of her changed plans; even
now Angela might be protesting with her and urging
her not to dispose of a real title so carelessly.
Even without the title Angela would not approve
of the broken engagement, for it had been announced
in her house; therefore, she had, in a way,
been sponsor for it, and would want to see it go
through to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made her way to the enclosed veranda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>where she had kept her rendezvous with Pendragon
on the afternoon of her arrival. It was quite deserted
now, but far out on the crest of one of the
near hills she saw a moving, black splotch against
the snow that as she watched gradually resolved
itself into three figures—John Peyton-Russell, Terry
and Professor Pendragon. It gave her a strange
thrill to see them thus—Pendragon striding along
with the rest. Surely this was a miracle—a Christmas
miracle, and she remembered a sentence in an
old book of witchcraft that she had once read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Verily there be magic both black and white, but
of these two, the white magic prevaileth ever over
the black.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ruth did not see Gloria until just before
luncheon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told him, and he’s going,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he make much of a row?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not after I explained that you hadn’t any
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s not talk about him any more—only has he
gone yet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he wouldn’t even wait until train time.
Said he could get luncheon in the village and started
out as soon as he could pack. I’m so happy about
it—now you can marry Professor Pendragon
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She realized at once that she shouldn’t have said
it, but she had left so much unsaid during the last
few weeks and now with both George and Prince
Aglipogue gone she felt that the seal had been removed
from her lips. She felt too, in a curious way,
that Gloria though so many years older, was in a
way her special charge—that she was entering a new
life and must be guided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria looked at her with startled eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What nonsense! You’re too romantic, Ruth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Gloria, you do love him; you can’t deny it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Didn’t you tell me once that he is the only one
you’ve ever really loved?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It takes two to make a marriage, Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he loves you too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so, and even if I would marry again, you
must realize that men very rarely marry the women
they love. That’s why we separated, I think. We
married for love and that is always disastrous. I
should never have married at all. Tomorrow we’ll
go back to town and Percy and I will each go our
separate ways and forget the horrible nightmare of
this place. It was just chance that we met—a weird
freak of coincidence. He didn’t want it; neither
did I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing that Ruth could answer and
presently Gloria went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No woman was meant to have both a career
and a husband; lots of them try it—most women
in fact, but usually they come to grief. It isn’t
written in the stars that one woman should have
both loves, art and a husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth thought of Nels and Dorothy. Would they
come to grief she wondered. As for herself she
didn’t have to choose—love didn’t come and art had
turned its back on her. She wondered if it was
written in the stars that she should have neither art
nor love. Then she remembered Pendragon’s quotation,
“The stars incline, but do not compel.” So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>many things had happened here perhaps another
miracle would be performed. She wondered why
Gloria said nothing about Pendragon’s sudden recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a relief not to see Prince Aglipogue at the
luncheon table. The dinner guests of the night
before had all returned to their own homes.
Aglipogue was gone, and Ruth wondered if Angela
would be troubled, because, for once, there was an
uneven number of people at the table. She did look
a bit troubled, though she was trying hard to conceal
it. An engagement announced and broken
within twenty-four hours was rather trying. Still
she was smiling:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got news of your servant, Gloria
dear,—rather horrid news. It’s quite a shock—a
bad way to end a pleasant Christmas party,
even though he was only a servant, and not a very
good one.” She paused, but no one came to her
rescue with questions or information and she went
on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They found him in the snow—he must have
tried to walk to the station and got lost—he was
dead—frozen—and he had the—that horrible beast
with him—the dead snake wound round his body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice broke hysterically and she shivered
with horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They didn’t bring him here—thank God—but
took him to an undertaker’s in the village. If he
has any relatives that you could wire—”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“None that I know of—they wouldn’t be in
America anyway,” said Gloria, quite calmly, though
her face was pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then Terry said he’d arrange things, you know—one
place is as good as another. I’m glad you
take it so quietly—it’s an awful ending.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must have been furious because Pendragon
shot the snake,” said Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, if the excitement of killing a snake could
cure Pen, Miss Mayfield ought to be willing to
sacrifice her servant,” said John Peyton-Russell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It really was remarkable—though I have
heard of similar instances—of paralytics leaving
their beds during the excitement of a fire, and
that sort of thing— I trust there will be no
relapse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gilchrist’s tone left no doubt in the minds
of her hearers that she was prepared for the worst.
Indeed, her eyes were constantly fastened on Professor
Pendragon as if she expected him to fall
down at any minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be none, thank you,” said Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth and Terry exchanged glances. Ruth’s eyes
asked Terry, “Do you believe me now?” and
Terry’s answered, “I don’t know— I don’t understand
it at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course we’re all very happy over Professor
Pendragon’s recovery,” said Gloria in her most conventional
voice, “and of course I don’t really feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>any loss about George, though I am sorry he died
that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is tragic, but now he’s really gone, Gloria,”
said Terry. “I’m awfully glad to be rid of him.
He was the most disagreeable servant I ever met,
if one can be said to meet servants. I don’t think
George ever really accepted me. He used to snub
me most horribly and I don’t like being snubbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That reminds me that you haven’t any servant
at all, Gloria, so you really must stay here a few
days longer. Perhaps I can find some for you—she
really can’t go back now, can she, John?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, Angela, that’s unfair; of course I want
Miss Mayfield to stay—we planned to have everybody
over the New Year. Perhaps Professor Pendragon
can persuade her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had little luck in persuading women to
do anything—if Prince Aglipogue had not left us
so suddenly he might have been more successful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a little embarrassed silence around the
table after Pendragon had spoken, then Angela began
talking of some irrelevant subject and the conversation
went on, but always Ruth observed that
neither Gloria nor Pendragon ever spoke directly to
each other, though the omission was so cleverly disguised
that no one at the table observed it except
Terry and Ruth who always seemed to see everything
together. Ruth had been so busy with Gloria
and her affairs that she had talked very little to
Terry and never alone; but they conversed nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>constantly reading each other’s eyes as clearly
as they would a printed page. The same things
seemed to amuse them both and except in the realm
of mystery which Ruth’s childhood had built about
her, they understood each other perfectly. She
knew now that he wanted to talk to her, but she
pretended not to see, for having begun her task of
managing the happiness of Gloria, she was determined
to go on, and the person she wanted to see
alone was Professor Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angela who always advertised her house as “one
of those places where you can do exactly what you
please,” and therefore never on any occasion let
any one do as they pleased if she could possibly prevent
it by a continuous program of “amusement”
and “entertainment,” was trying to interest them
in a plan to go skating that evening by moonlight
on a little lake that lay halfway between Fir Tree
Farm and the village. Some one had reported that
the ice was clear of snow and what was the good
of being in the country in winter time if one didn’t
go in for winter sport?</p>

<p class='c007'>Her plans fell on rather unenthusiastic ears. The
men, having enjoyed a long hike in the morning,
were not eager for more exercise; Gloria wanted
to spend the afternoon preparing to leave the next
morning; Ruth was not interested in anything that
did not seem to offer any furtherance of her plans
for Gloria; and Miss Gilchrist didn’t skate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very atmosphere seemed to say that the party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>was finished; that these people had, for the time
being, said all they had to say to each other and
for the time, and wanted to be gone along their several
roads. It is a wise hostess who recognizes this
situation and apparently Angela did recognize it,
for she finally stopped urging her scheme and
when Gloria asked Ruth to help her pack—Gloria
always went on a week-end equipped as for transcontinental
travel—Angela made no effort to detain
them or to go with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gloria’s moment of confidences had passed. She
talked now, but of Terry’s play. She had told him
of her changed decision and he seemed very happy
about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you’ll have a chance to make sketches
of us,” she said to Ruth, awakening again Ruth’s
interest in the work to which she also was returning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll find two women servants some place and
go on as before, Ruth. Except that I’m not going
to see quite so many people—only people I really
like after this. You know I really love the old
house—as near home as anything I’ll ever have.
Wish we could get Amy back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can,” said Ruth. “Amy and I had an
agreement when she left that she would come back
if you ever got rid of George. I have her address.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, Ruth!” said Gloria, looking at her with
genuine admiration, “You are the most amazing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>young person I’ve ever met. You ought to write
a book on the care and training of aunts. It would
be a great success.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of this Ruth was not so sure. They were to leave
on the morning train and while she had accomplished
half her purpose she had not wholly succeeded.
Gloria and Pendragon had met and now
they were going to part more widely separated than
ever before, because their opportunity had come and
for some stupid reason they were both letting it go
without reaching out a hand or saying one word to
make it their own. And Gloria wasn’t happy—she
was just normal at last, and a normal Gloria was
rather a pitiful thing. She was like stale champagne—all
the sparkle gone out of her. It seemed
to Ruth that she could not live through another
meal with Gloria and Pendragon talking across and
around each other—Pendragon with his grave, quiet
face in which the lines of pain seemed to be set
forever—Gloria, changed and quiet, determined to
work and succeed again, not for the joy of her
work, but because it seemed the right thing to do.
Yet she did live through another dinner, a most unhappy
meal at which John and Angela sat trying to
talk, realizing that something more than they could
quite understand had gone wrong and not knowing
exactly what to do about it. Terry and Miss Gilchrist
relieved the tension somewhat, Terry consciously,
Miss Gilchrist unconsciously, because no
one else seemed able to talk, drew her out and once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>started on modern child training, there was no reason
for any one else making any effort. She ran
on endlessly with no more encouragement than an
occasional, “Oh quite, Really, Yes indeed, or How
interesting!” from Terry or Pendragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>What hurt more than anything was that Terry
no longer signalled Ruth with his eyes. There was
no longer any interest or invitation in them. If he
had had anything to say to her he had forgotten it
or lost interest, for now he seemed to avoid exchange
of words or glances with her as much as
Gloria and Pendragon avoided each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a feeble attempt on the part of
Angela to start a conversation with some semblance
of animation over the coffee cups in the library afterward,
but finally even she surrendered as one by one
they made excuses of weariness, the early train or
no excuse at all and drifted away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruth watched for Pendragon’s going and followed
him. He made his way to the enclosed
veranda. She stood a moment looking through the
glass door, watching him as he paced up and down,
smoking a pipe. What she was going to do required
courage; she might only meet with the cold
rebuff that is due to meddlesome persons, but
Gloria’s happiness was at stake and she could only
fail, so she walked timidly out to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She waited patiently until he turned and faced
her. She thought she saw a look of disappointment
cross his face when he saw who had interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>his solitude. That look, fancied or real, encouraged
her to go on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to thank you for doing what you did—for
not giving up, and to tell you how happy I am
that you’re well again,” she began.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—I am well again—I walk and eat and
sleep and wake again—I am alive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I wanted to ask you if you’re going to stop
now— You’ve saved Gloria from George and
from the Prince—are you going to let her go away
now that you have accomplished so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child, I can’t kidnap Gloria—she’s not
the sort of woman one kidnaps—not even the sort
one woos and wins. She is the other sort—the only
sort worth while I think—the princess who calls her
own swayamvara, and makes her own choice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But she did choose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has chosen too often.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean that even if Gloria still loved you
you would not marry her just because she has—because
she has—”</p>

<p class='c007'>All her old ideas and training rose up and kept
her from finishing the sentence “because she has
had two other husbands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Gloria had married one hundred men I would
still want her—don’t you understand that?” He
spoke almost fiercely. “But you don’t understand—you’re
too young; it isn’t that; but Gloria doesn’t
love me. If she did she would tell me so. She
knows that I love her and she has shown very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>plainly that she doesn’t want my love. I appreciate
your kindness,” he went on in a calmer tone, “but
don’t trouble any more—what is written is written
and can’t be changed no matter how one tries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I give you my word of honour that Gloria
does love you, what then? She told me so—she
does know that you love her, but she thinks you
don’t—she thinks the husbands make a difference.
She doesn’t believe that a man could understand
that they were just—just incidents.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither laughed at the idea of this twenty-year
old girl speaking of two husbands as incidents,
though later Ruth remembered it herself, and
thought it rather funny.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not answer,—he was standing quite rigidly,
staring at the door, and, turning, Ruth saw
Gloria approaching them:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry; I thought you were alone, Ruth,”
she said and hesitated as if she would have gone
back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve just remembered,” said Pendragon, “that
the small star Eros is supposed to be visible again
about this time, but we have no telescope. Ruth has
not found it, though she has young eyes— Perhaps
you and I, together, Gloria—if we looked very
closely—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the clear starlight she saw them in each
other’s arms. There was one very bright star, that
seemed to hang lower in the sky than winter stars
are wont to hang. Surely it was the star of love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>though doubtless no astronomer had ever named it
so. She did not know exactly where she was going
when she left them there, but she was very happy.
And then halfway down the stairs she sat down because
her happiness was overflowing from her eyes
in tears and she couldn’t see, and suddenly she felt
very tired. It was there that Terry, ascending,
found her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say—what’s wrong? You’re crying. I saw
you with Pendragon—has he done anything to hurt
you? I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No-it’s not that—I’m crying because I’m so
happy—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her half-disappointed, half-relieved
and wholly bewildered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Gloria and Pendragon—they’ve made up.”
She reverted to the vernacular of childhood. “I’m
so happy because they’re happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I thought—I thought you cared for Pendragon,”
stumbled Terry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s funny—what made you think that? I
do like him but mostly for Gloria’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here,” said Terry. “If you don’t love
Pendragon who do you love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was smiling through her tears now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it absolutely necessary that I should love
some one? You know I always thought that you
loved Gloria. If you don’t love Gloria, whom do
you love?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>For a moment he looked down into her upturned
face, struggling against the provocation of her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love the most charming, youngest, most mature,
most unselfish, most winsome—oh, there
aren’t adjectives enough. Who do you love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The nicest—the very nicest and cleverest man
in the world,” she answered demurely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nicest—I’m not quite sure that I like that adjective
applied to a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t help it—we can’t all have playwright’s
vocabularies, you know. I could draw him better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent over very near to her while her clever
fingers made rapid strokes. When it was finished
she looked up at him with shy daring in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is my nose really like that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you guess who it was meant for?”
she teased, and turned her head quickly, because she
was not quite sure even now that she was ready for
that wonderful first kiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve always wanted to kiss you just below that
little curl anyway,” whispered Terry. “And now
your lips, please.”</p>
